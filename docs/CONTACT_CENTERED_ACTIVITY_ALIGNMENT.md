# Actual fixed-order centered contact activity

The contact conclusion of companion T14.1 is now proved at its full
N^(-1+epsilon) scale, unconditionally, on every original dyadic subground
and at every fixed order r>=2. The actual population consists exactly of
r-site families containing distinct sites x<y<=x+L, with no connectedness
restriction. Irregular starts, incompatible families and zero marginals
are included. The separate source connected 4/5 conclusion remains open,
so T14.1 remains in progress and no numbered result is counted complete.

The proof gives a more general finite statement on an arbitrary finite
Boolean probability space. For actual heterogeneous marginals p_x, a
family containing one of the specified two-site seeds satisfies

    sum_I |c(I)| <= R^(r-2) * sum_e(q(e)+3*prod_(x in e)p_x)
                   + E[(Z+mu)^m]/R^(m-r),

for every R>0 and fixed integer m>=r. No independence, regularity, common
marginal or positive seed mass is assumed. Absolute centered products are
bounded by products of J_x+p_x. The finite seed-cover inequality bounds
the family sum by the positive seed sum times (Z+mu)^(r-2). Below R this
costs R^(r-2) times the seed sum; above R the full product is bounded by
the higher moment divided by R^(m-r). The seed expectation is exactly
q(e)+3*prod p, retaining all four Boolean expansion terms.

For the original arithmetic model, a positive joint close pair must have
y=x+L, by exact run separation. The actual endpoint seed count bounds its
total joint mass. An explicit forward-neighbor cover proves
sum_(close e)prod p <= L*p_max*mu, including all heterogeneous marginals.
The contact seed kernel is therefore at most N^(-1+delta) for every fixed
delta>0. Every fixed positive-envelope moment E[(Z+mu)^m] is also at most
N^delta, using the newly checked unconditional subpower count moments.
Choose delta=epsilon/(4(r+1)), then one fixed higher moment m before N,
and finally R=N^delta. Both truncation terms have the required exponent;
the last constant is absorbed only after these exact estimates.

This replaces the source contact proof's use of uniformly bounded fixed
moments by the weaker unconditional subpower estimates. It also removes
the regular-ground/common-marginal restriction from this contact conclusion.
The proof is recorded as improvement P1-MATH-0091 for a future manuscript
revision. It asserts no source error, connected 4/5 bound, growing-order
control or complete fixed-moment asymptotic. Main 6.4 and T14.1 remain in
progress; coverage 77/167 (main 28/73, companion 49/94), improvements 91.

## Exact-contact refinements and improvement P1-MATH-0094

The literal dyadic exact-contact edge family is now constructed as
{x,x+L} with both starts in I_N. If the full union window of length 2L
is regular, every prescribed pair atom is exactly 2^(-2L). This follows
from a general full-effective-rank tuple uniformity theorem; affine
compatibility is proved by full rank rather than assumed. Uniform
irregular-window counts apply at length 2L with the enlarged logarithmic
width, and at least N/2 admissible contact starts have regular unions.
Consequently there is a positive c_C with

    c_C*N^(-1) <= M_contact <= N^(-1+epsilon)

for all sufficiently large critical N,L. The lower bound retains the
actual moving length phase through 2^(-2L). The general positive-family
activation theorem then gives

    N^(-1-epsilon) <= P(an active exact-contact edge) <= N^(-1+epsilon).

A generic positive-mass cover theorem proves that deleting probability-zero
members preserves the actual activation probability. Every positive-mass
close pair has separation exactly L, so the same probability bounds hold
for the event that two original active starts have distance at most L.
All statements concern the original infinite prime-sign probability law,
with both dyadic endpoints enforced and no BCN premise.

For centered coefficients the regular unions contribute zero, since their
actual pair rank loss is zero. Only the irregular full unions remain.
Their subpower count, the actual N^(-2+epsilon) point mass cap and exact
heterogeneous marginal caps prove the stronger bound

    sum_(exact-contact e) |c(e)| <= N^(-2+epsilon).

This improvement is specific to exact separation L. Strictly closer,
incompatible pairs can have negative centered coefficients and are not
included in that stronger exponent. It does not improve the already proved
N^(-1+epsilon) bound for all close-pair centered activity at arbitrary
fixed order. These positive-probability and exact covariance refinements
are recorded as improvement P1-MATH-0094. Main 6.3 stays proved; T7.1 and
T14.1 stay in progress. Coverage stays 77/167 (main 28/73, companion 49/94),
confirmed improvements 94. No full pair profile, multiplicative contact
probability equivalent, growing-order result, external premise, axiom,
dependency download, original-source change or Palomar registration is
introduced.
