# Mathematical corrections and improvements

Baseline: original P1 V1.6 article and companion, 31 October 2026, preserved in
`manuscripts/paper-p1/v1.6/`. This log is separate from the original package's
historical reviews and editorial revisions.

**One mathematical improvement is confirmed; no error in a manuscript conclusion
has been confirmed.** The paper has not yet undergone a complete formal audit.
Absence of an entry does not mean the argument has been verified.

## P1-MATH-0001 — Weaker algebra assumptions for Lemma 5.1

- Location: main article, Lemma 5.1, page 19, label `p1:stop:polynomial`,
  `main_sections/stopped.tex:40` in V1.6.
- Original setting: a commutative unital algebra.
- Improvement: a commutative semiring suffices. The identity requires only
  finite sums and products, distributivity, zero and one. Additive inverses and
  a scalar algebra structure are unnecessary.
- Evidence: `PaperP1.Algebra.stopped_expansion`, proved in Lean v4.36.0-rc2
  with the exact scalar parameter, ordered boundary and suffix. The supporting
  lemmas identify the proper prefix with deletion of the maximum.
- Suggested revision: state the identity for elements `t, u_x` of any
  commutative semiring. The signed-measure application, all estimates and all
  asymptotic exponents are unchanged.
- Status: confirmed by compilation and the kernel-axiom audit; not yet
  integrated into a new manuscript version.

Every finding receives a stable identifier `P1-MATH-0001`, etc., and an entry in
[mathematical-changes.json](mathematical-changes.json). Keep the following fields:

| Field | Required content |
|---|---|
| Location | Document, version, label, number, page, source file and lines |
| Original statement | Exact claim and hypotheses, with source identity |
| Finding | Concrete gap, counterexample, missing hypothesis or improvement |
| Classification | Confirmed correction, improvement, clarification, or open question |
| Evidence | Lean declaration/proof, exact computation, or mathematical derivation |
| Proposed revision | Precise replacement text or corrected quantifier/hypothesis |
| Impact | Other results, constants, exponents and proof dependencies affected |
| Validation | Pending / confirmed / rejected, with reason and exact commit |
| Manuscript integration | Target future version and integrated / not integrated |

Do not silently strengthen assumptions or weaken a conclusion to make a proof
compile. Record the discrepancy before changing the formal target. Distinguish
a missing Lean-library lemma from an actual mathematical gap. An unproved
arithmetic estimate is an open formalization obligation, not automatically a
counterexample to the paper. Preserve rejected findings with their resolution.

## Initial proof obligations to inspect

These are priorities, **not established errors**:

- Uniformity in coefficients and degree in the companion's arithmetic inputs.
- Effective spaces and affine incompatibility when a window has a local relation.
- Conditional propagation and the distinction between fixed and growing order.
- Exact heterogeneous marginals and repeated-index factorial-cumulant terms.
- The three reconstruction errors, positivity, and the fourth-order lower bound.
- The distinction between primitive supports and canonical direct components.
