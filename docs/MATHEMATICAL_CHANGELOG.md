# Mathematical corrections and improvements

Baseline: original P1 V1.6 article and companion, 31 October 2026, preserved in
`manuscripts/paper-p1/v1.6/`. This log is separate from the original package's
historical reviews and editorial revisions.

**Six mathematical improvements are confirmed; no error in a manuscript conclusion
has been confirmed.** The paper has not yet undergone a complete formal audit.
Absence of an entry does not mean the argument has been verified.

## P1-MATH-0001 — Weaker algebra assumptions for Lemma 5.1

- Location: main article, Lemma 5.1, page 19, label `p1:stop:polynomial`,
  `main_sections/stopped.tex:40` in V1.6.
- Original setting: a commutative unital algebra.
- Improvement: a commutative semiring suffices. The identity requires only
  finite sums and products, distributivity, zero and one. Additive inverses and
  a scalar algebra structure are unnecessary.
- Evidence: `PaperP1.Algebra.stopped_expansion`, proved in Lean v4.36.0-rc2
  with the exact scalar parameter, ordered boundary and suffix. The supporting
  lemmas identify the proper prefix with deletion of the maximum.
- Suggested revision: state the identity for elements `t, u_x` of any
  commutative semiring. The signed-measure application, all estimates and all
  asymptotic exponents are unchanged.
- Status: confirmed by compilation and the kernel-axiom audit; not yet
  integrated into a new manuscript version.

## P1-MATH-0002 — Entirely algebraic proof of companion T1.1

- Location: technical companion, Lemma T1.1, page 5, label `p1:arith:runge`,
  `companion_sections/arithmetic_appendix.tex:19` in V1.6.
- Original proof: analytic square-root branches, a Cauchy coefficient bound,
  a tail estimate and a separate auxiliary-polynomial equality case.
- Improvement: finite formal-series coefficients and integer-square separation
  prove the same degree-uniform conclusion `U ≤ (64R)^d`. The proof needs no
  analytic branch choice, convergence argument or tail estimate.
- Evidence: `PaperP1.SplitProductBound.uniform_split_product_real_radius`,
  `PaperP1.RungeUniform.rungeQ_height_le`, and the intermediate nonzero-value
  height bound. Real radii, integer bases and every even degree are retained.
- Suggested revision: replace the proof by the algebraic argument detailed in
  [SPLIT_PRODUCT_ALIGNMENT.md](SPLIT_PRODUCT_ALIGNMENT.md). Its auxiliary
  height bound is `H(Q) ≤ (k+1)2^(5d)R^d ≤ (64R)^d`; both branches give
  `U ≤ H(Q)` directly.
- Impact: no change to T1.1's hypotheses, conclusion, constant or downstream
  exponents. This is a proof simplification; no error in the original proof
  is claimed, and its analytic inequalities have not been separately checked.
- Status: confirmed by compilation and the kernel-axiom audit; not yet
  integrated into a new manuscript version.

## P1-MATH-0003 — Weaker cutoff hypotheses for T1.3

- Location: companion Lemma T1.3, page 6, label `p1:arith:defects`,
  `companion_sections/arithmetic_appendix.tex:90`, all three conclusions.
- Original setting: B is comparable to log N and H is comparable to B, with
  fixed comparison constants shared by the combined lemma.
- Improvement: the local estimate needs only H=O(B), with B comparable to log N.
  The global count needs only H ≤ D log N and a linear counting
  height. The two-defect-window count needs only H ≤ D log N and L ≤ E log N.
  Fixed D,E ≥ 0 suffice; a lower bound on H and the intermediate B are
  unnecessary for the last two conclusions. The lower comparison H ≳ B is
  unnecessary for the local estimate as well. The paper's domain H ≥ 2
  remains covered, including fixed bounded cutoffs.
- Evidence: `GlobalDefectCount.global_defect_count_le_rpow_eventually`,
  `TwoDefectCount.two_defect_count_le_rpow_eventually`, and
  `TwoDefectWindows.dyadic_two_defect_windows_le_rpow_eventually`, and the
  complete `UniformDefectCounts.companion_T1_3_run_length` and
  `companion_T1_3_run_length_fixed_affine` statements.
  Actual finite sets and a threshold before all cutoffs and lengths are used.
- Suggested revision: replace H ≍ B by H=O(B) in the local estimate, and state
  the global and two-defect estimates separately under their upper logarithmic
  bounds. The B ≍ log N comparison remains in the local estimate. See
  [exact alignment](TWO_DEFECT_ALIGNMENT.md).
- Impact: strengthens parameter scope, including bounded or smaller cutoffs;
  the exponents 1/2 and 0 are unchanged. T1.3 is now complete, including the
  local estimate and fixed real affine interval versions.
- Status: confirmed by full compilation and the 862-declaration kernel-axiom
  audit; not yet integrated into a new manuscript version. The JSON record
  preserves the earlier 830-declaration validation of the first two components.

## P1-MATH-0004 — A lower base bound suffices for local rigidity

- Location: article Lemma 2.1, page 11, label `p1:limits:local-rigidity`,
  `main_sections/exact_setup.tex:27` in V1.6. The source block is unchanged.
- Original setting: U ≍ N and B=O(log N), followed by the sharp fixed-order
  logarithmic rank thresholds and subcritical relative-sign independence.
- Improvement: fix a>0 and require only U≥aN. The upper bound U=O(N) is
  unnecessary for every local-rigidity conclusion. The rank bound is also
  uniform for all positive B≤c log N whenever c<2-2^(1-t), rather than only
  a chosen sequence B~c log N. A single threshold precedes all U and B.
- Evidence: `UniformLocalRigidity.finite_griesmer_eventually`,
  `uniform_relation_rank_lt`,
  `LocalRigidityRegimes.relation_rank_lt_of_length_asymptotic`,
  `critical_relation_rank_le_one_of_error`,
  `RelativeSignIndependence.subcritical_window_relative_signs_independent`,
  and `LocalRigidityConsequences.critical_band_marginals`.
  The rounded common cap, sharp PNT budget and actual relation-code extension
  are proved; independence uses the full product law under the infinite model.
- Suggested revision: state local rigidity uniformly for U≥aN, with a fixed
  positive a. State the general rank consequence uniformly for every
  B≤c log N below the same threshold. Keep t fixed before the asymptotic
  threshold. In the finite Griesmer inequality alone, t can vary after N;
  that finite threshold is independent of t.
- Impact: enlarges the arithmetic domain, including bases that grow faster
  than N. The constant 64, critical coefficient 1/log 2, sharp rank
  thresholds and all error exponents are unchanged. In the original dyadic
  application, the exact heterogeneous marginals remain p or 2p, with the
  proved pointwise bound `(2 * 2^C)/N` in a fixed critical band.
- Status: confirmed by full Lean 4.36.0-rc2 compilation and the actual
  1,223-declaration kernel-axiom audit; not yet integrated into a new paper
  version. See [local rigidity alignment](LOCAL_RIGIDITY_ALIGNMENT.md).

## P1-MATH-0005 — A stronger finite local-square threshold

- Location: companion T9.1, page 39, `p13:rig:local-square`,
  `companion_sections/pair_rigidity.tex:17`.
- Original condition: x>(B+1)^(12m), B≥2, where m is the positive even
  cardinality of the actual offset set I⊆[-B,B].
- Improvement: x>(64B)^m suffices. Since 64B≤(B+1)^5 for every B≥2,
  the simpler condition x>(B+1)^(5m) suffices as well.
- Evidence: `LocalSquareThreshold.local_square_threshold_sharp`,
  `local_square_threshold_power_five` and `companion_T9_1`. These are proved
  from the internal degree-uniform T1.1 theorem after an exact reindexing of
  the finite integer set. The threshold supplies the required base condition.
- Suggested revision: use the sharper (64B)^m threshold or replace 12m by
  5m, and replace the analytic truncation argument with this short consequence
  of T1.1. No optimality of the new threshold is claimed.
- Impact: strengthens finite local square exclusion without changing the
  original conclusion, offset domain, evenness or later asymptotic exponents.
- Status: confirmed by Lean compilation and actual kernel audit; not integrated
  into a new manuscript. See [alignment](LOCAL_SQUARE_THRESHOLD_ALIGNMENT.md).

## P1-MATH-0006 — An absolute constant for critical defective positions

- Location: companion T9.2, page 39, `p13:rig:defective`,
  `companion_sections/pair_rigidity.tex:62`.
- Original bound: O_C(B/log B) for the actual 10B-defective positions.
- Improvement: there is one absolute K>0 before the band width C. For each
  fixed C, only N0(C) changes. The same K bounds every start and every length
  in that critical band by K B/log B, with B=L+1.
- Evidence: `CriticalDefectPositions.uniform_critical_defect_constant`,
  `companion_T9_2` and the exact kernel/interval dictionary. The already proved
  T1.3 local count uses fixed dyadic-base and logarithmic-scale comparisons;
  their constants are independent of C once N exceeds a C-dependent threshold.
- Suggested revision: state the quantifier order ∃K>0, ∀C, ∃N0(C), followed
  by all N, L and x. Preserve the eventual character of the result.
- Impact: strengthens constant uniformity. The cutoff 10B, rate B/log B and
  original conclusions are unchanged. No regularity or admissibility premise
  is introduced, and no uniform threshold over unbounded C is asserted.
- Status: confirmed by Lean compilation and actual kernel audit; not integrated
  into a new manuscript. See [alignment](LOCAL_SQUARE_THRESHOLD_ALIGNMENT.md).

Every finding receives a stable identifier `P1-MATH-0001`, etc., and an entry in
[mathematical-changes.json](mathematical-changes.json). Keep the following fields:

| Field | Required content |
|---|---|
| Location | Document, version, label, number, page, source file and lines |
| Original statement | Exact claim and hypotheses, with source identity |
| Finding | Concrete gap, counterexample, missing hypothesis or improvement |
| Classification | Confirmed correction, improvement, clarification, or open question |
| Evidence | Lean declaration/proof, exact computation, or mathematical derivation |
| Proposed revision | Precise replacement text or corrected quantifier/hypothesis |
| Impact | Other results, constants, exponents and proof dependencies affected |
| Validation | Pending / confirmed / rejected, with reason and exact commit |
| Manuscript integration | Target future version and integrated / not integrated |

Do not silently strengthen assumptions or weaken a conclusion to make a proof
compile. Record the discrepancy before changing the formal target. Distinguish
a missing Lean-library lemma from an actual mathematical gap. An unproved
arithmetic estimate is an open formalization obligation, not automatically a
counterexample to the paper. Preserve rejected findings with their resolution.

## Initial proof obligations to inspect

These are priorities, **not established errors**:

- Uniformity in coefficients and degree in the companion's arithmetic inputs.
- Effective spaces and affine incompatibility when a window has a local relation.
- Conditional propagation and the distinction between fixed and growing order.
- Exact heterogeneous marginals and repeated-index factorial-cumulant terms.
- The three reconstruction errors, positivity, and the fourth-order lower bound.
- The distinction between primitive supports and canonical direct components.

## Regular-set transfer verification — no new mathematical finding

The complete conclusion of article Proposition 3.1 has been checked, including
arbitrary affine targets, incompatible exceptional windows, actual infinite
count laws, both means, and the conditional fixed-moment and second factorial-
cumulant transfers. The latter retain the bounded-fixed-moments premise and
the diagonal term -E Z. A prescribed length sequence requires moment bounds
only along that sequence. The proof gives the explicit combined constant
4·2^C without changing the manuscript's exponent. This regular-set checkpoint added no correction or improvement entry.
The later local-square and defect-constant improvements are recorded above
as P1-MATH-0005 and P1-MATH-0006. See
[statement alignment](REGULAR_SET_ALIGNMENT.md).
