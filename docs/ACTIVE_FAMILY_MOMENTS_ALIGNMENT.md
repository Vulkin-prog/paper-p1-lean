# Uniform original-model active-family moments and probability

A general original-model positive-family theorem now applies to every
fixed positive cardinality s and fixed positive moment order r. Let F be
any deterministic family of s-element subsets of any dyadic subground G,
Xi_F the number of fully active members, and M_F=sum_(e in F)q(e).
For every fixed epsilon>0, one threshold works uniformly for all critical
lengths, subgrounds and such families, and gives

    E[Xi_F^r] <= N^epsilon*M_F,
    M_F*N^(-epsilon) <= P(Xi_F>0) <= M_F.

There is no independence, common-marginal, regularity, positive-source-mass
or BCN premise. F may vary after N. The fixed s,r,epsilon precede the
threshold. The theorem does not cover growing s or growing r.

The proof transports the checked source propagation to unordered joint
rows after every nonempty seed of bounded cardinality. A finite recurrence
expresses each seeded count moment of degree k as the sum of the moments
after one inserted target. Iteration costs A^k when each row costs A.
Since Xi_F<=Z_G^s, this controls Xi_F^r after the first active member by
s(r-1) extra targets. The exponent margin is chosen before this iteration.
No division by the source mass is used, including when M_F=0.
A separate finite linear truncation converts E[Xi_F^2]<=B*M_F into
M_F<=4B*P(Xi_F>0), and the last constant is absorbed into the exponent.

This supplies a general probability and moment corollary of main 6.3,
recorded as improvement P1-MATH-0093. It includes the literal principal
edge family as s=2 and strengthens the route to its logarithmic activation
exponent. It does not give P(Xi_F>0)~M_F, a sharp second factorial moment,
the full signed pair profile, or any growing-order bound. Main 6.3 stays
proved; main 3.4 and T1.17 stay in progress. Coverage remains 77/167 (main
28/73, companion 49/94), confirmed improvements 93. No new external input,
axiom, dependency download, original-source change or Palomar registration
is introduced.
