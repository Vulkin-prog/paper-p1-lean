# The actual two-channel beta and its source positive phase

The actual principal edge family is now the union of the compatible,
private, dependent unordered populations in channels 2:3 and 3:4.
An exact displacement argument proves their disjointness once
29(L+1)<N: simultaneous channel alignments force the first center
below 29(L+1), contradicting its dyadic location. Its cardinality is at
most 26(L+1)N. Its joint mass beta is exactly half the sum of the two
ordered channel masses; probability-zero pairs were removed without
changing these masses.

For every fixed C,D there are positive c,k and one threshold such that,
for every critical L and 8(L+1)<=H<=D(L+1),

    c*L*N^(-2/3) <= beta <= k*L*N^(-2/3).

This is the source positive phase for the literal two-channel beta,
unconditionally. The correction from beta to its own absolute centered
activity is nonnegative and at most N^(-1+epsilon), uniformly in H.
Combining this exact subfamily with the already checked full
absolute-activity/cumulant gap also proves the one-sided comparison

    2*beta - actual_alpha <= N^(-1+epsilon),

without BCN or a complete pair profile. This is only one side of the
source absolute residual estimate. The reverse inequality at exponent
4/5, the full bad-pair activity and the complete signed pair profile
remain open. Main 3.4 stays in progress. Coverage stays 77/167 (main
28/73, companion 49/94), confirmed improvements 91. No new correction,
external input, axiom, dependency download, original-source change or
Palomar registration is introduced.
