# The actual two-channel beta and its source positive phase

The actual principal edge family is now the union of the compatible,
private, dependent unordered populations in channels 2:3 and 3:4.
An exact displacement argument proves their disjointness once
29(L+1)<N: simultaneous channel alignments force the first center
below 29(L+1), contradicting its dyadic location. Its cardinality is at
most 26(L+1)N. Its joint mass beta is exactly half the sum of the two
ordered channel masses; probability-zero pairs were removed without
changing these masses.

For every fixed C,D there are positive c,k and one threshold such that,
for every critical L and 8(L+1)<=H<=D(L+1),

    c*L*N^(-2/3) <= beta <= k*L*N^(-2/3).

This is the source positive phase for the literal two-channel beta,
unconditionally. The correction from beta to its own absolute centered
activity is nonnegative and at most N^(-1+epsilon), uniformly in H.
Combining this exact subfamily with the already checked full
absolute-activity/cumulant gap also proves the one-sided comparison

    2*beta - actual_alpha <= N^(-1+epsilon),

without BCN or a complete pair profile. This is only one side of the
source absolute residual estimate. The reverse inequality at exponent
4/5, the full bad-pair activity and the complete signed pair profile
remain open. Main 3.4 stays in progress. Coverage stays 77/167 (main
28/73, companion 49/94), confirmed improvements 91. No new correction,
external input, axiom, dependency download, original-source change or
Palomar registration is introduced.

## Actual principal-edge activation and improvement P1-MATH-0092

The literal positive count Xi of active edges in any deterministic finite
pair family is now constructed on the original infinite prime-sign model.
Its value is the number of edges all of whose sites are active. Exact
finite-cylinder transport proves its first moment is the sum of actual
joint masses and its positivity event is precisely the union of the edge
events. A finite combinatorial estimate bounds Xi by Z_G^2. For every
R>0 and fixed m>=2 the actual truncation inequality is

    sum_(e in F)q(e) <= R^2*P(Xi>0)+E[Z_G^m]/R^(m-2).

The first Bonferroni correction is proved for every integer-valued finite
count, then transported to the actual original edge count:

    0 <= E[Xi]-P(Xi>0) <= E[Xi*(Xi-1)]/2.

For the literal principal channels 2:3 and 3:4, E[Xi]=beta exactly.
Their already proved positive beta phase and the unconditional subpower
fixed count moments imply, for every fixed epsilon>0 and C,D, one uniform
threshold for all critical lengths and 8(L+1)<=H<=D(L+1),

    N^(-2/3-epsilon) <= P(Xi>0) <= N^(-2/3+epsilon).

The proof chooses delta=epsilon/4, one fixed higher moment m=2+k with
delta*k>=2, and R=N^delta. The tail is bounded by N^(-3/2), which is
absorbed into half the positive beta lower bound. This needs neither BCN,
a complete signed pair profile, uniformly bounded fixed moments nor the
sharp second-factorial-moment estimate. The logarithmic rare-event exponent
is recorded as improvement P1-MATH-0092 for later manuscript integration.
It does not imply P(Xi>0)~beta or E[(Xi)_2]~beta^2; those sharp assertions
of T1.17 remain open. T1.17 moves from not_started to in_progress; main
3.4 stays in progress. Coverage remains 77/167 (main 28/73, companion 49/94),
confirmed improvements 92. No new external input, axiom, download,
original-source change or Palomar registration is introduced.
