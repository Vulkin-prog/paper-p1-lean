# Actual projective scheme map

The actual rescaled standard-base inclusion now induces a constructed
morphism of schemes from the source Proj to the native standard
Veronese Proj. Its inverse image of every base basic open D(b) is
exactly the source basic open D(f(b)). This construction uses the
literal graded inclusion and the actual source quotient, rather
than an assumed projective model.

The admissibility criterion is proved: the source irrelevant ideal
is contained in the radical of the mapped base irrelevant ideal.
The source generators are proved to generate their actual ring;
the irrelevant ideal of a ring generated in degree one is proved
to be their ideal span. Each pure base generator lies in the mapped
base irrelevant ideal, while the square of each radical generator
lies there by its actual homogeneous radicand relation. These
arguments apply over every field, including zero radicand
coefficients, for positive D and root counts at most 2D.

The pinned Mathlib Proj functor takes the stronger condition
H_plus <= map(G_plus). The quadratic source supplies the sufficient
radical containment above. A local extension implements the point
map, its continuity, the structure-sheaf map and its locality on
stalks under that weaker condition, and bundles the resulting
Scheme.Hom. This is a library interface extension, not an error
in the manuscript or a new mathematical-change identifier.

Finiteness of the scheme morphism, identification of the base Proj
with the projective plane, the degree-zero function-field bridge,
the degree 2^k of the projective cover, surface degree 2^k D^2,
curve-degree identities and the external surface covering and
host counts remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress, numbered coverage
stays 79/167 and confirmed mathematical improvements stay 106.
No original manuscript source is changed. Palomar remains deferred.

## Upstream provenance and statement comparison

The generic scheme construction adapts
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/ProjectiveSpectrum/Functor.lean` at the
immutable Mathlib commit
`9d581dfff2e41de989072ea63abf3daf69311520`, matching Lean
`v4.36.0-rc2`. Upstream copyright (c) 2026 Kenny Lau and the Apache
2.0 license notice are retained in `Geometry/ProjRadicalMap.lean`;
the repository LICENSE is Apache 2.0. The dependency is unchanged.

The upstream hypothesis is containment of the source irrelevant
ideal in the mapped base irrelevant ideal. The local version takes
containment in its radical, proves the necessary contradiction at
every homogeneous prime, and makes the dependent point, sheaf and
stalk constructions use that proved point map. The actual source
module supplies this hypothesis by its checked quadratic equations.
No unproved algebraic-geometric input is introduced, and no further
Paper C source is reused. Compilation, axiom inspection and ledger
reference checks use the pinned rc2 toolchain.

## P1-MATH-0106 extended — Finiteness of the actual projective morphism

The constructed projective source morphism is now proved finite
as a morphism of schemes. This is the literal map from the source
Veronese Proj to the standard native Veronese Proj, not merely the
already verified finite map of affine cones. The theorem applies
over every field for arbitrary coefficients, positive D and root
counts at most 2D. Characteristic zero and root independence are
not required for finiteness.

For any nonnegatively graded commutative ring and any homogeneous
element b of degree one, a ring homomorphism to its degree-zero
homogeneous localization is constructed by sending each degree-n
component a to a/b^n. Compatibility with addition, multiplication
and one is proved, followed by its formula on homogeneous
elements, surjectivity and naturality for actual graded ring maps.
Surjectivity and naturality transport a finite total ring map to
a finite map of these actual chart rings, including degenerate
charts, without a nonzero or domain assumption.

The radical-admissible projective morphism is proved to restrict on
each degree-one basic open to the corresponding Spec map, under
the actual chart isomorphisms. Finiteness of that ring map proves
finiteness of each restricted scheme map. Degree-one base opens
cover the entire target by the proved irrelevant-ideal span
identity and generation in degree one. Zariski locality then
proves finiteness of the actual global projective morphism.

This extends the argument supporting P1-MATH-0106; no new
mathematical-change identifier is introduced. The cover's generic
degree, identification of the base Proj with the projective plane,
the degree-zero function-field bridge, the Hilbert calculation,
surface degree 2^k D^2, curve-degree identities and external host
counts remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress, coverage stays 79/167,
confirmed improvements stay 106 and Palomar remains deferred.

The first three proofs in `Geometry/ProjRadicalCharts.lean` adapt
the basic-open and localization compatibility proofs from the same
upstream Functor.lean file and pinned Mathlib commit recorded above.
The copyright and Apache 2.0 attribution are preserved. The new
dehomogenization and finiteness arguments are proved locally;
Mathlib's definition of finite scheme morphisms, its affine Spec
criterion and its Zariski locality supply the checked scheme API.
No external arithmetic estimate, original source change or further
Paper C port is introduced. Additional Mathlib dependencies were
compiled selectively, without downloading the full cache.


## P1-MATH-0106 extended — The actual finite flat cover has constant rank 2^k

The actual projective source morphism is now proved finite,
flat, surjective and of constant scheme rank 2^k. The rank statement
is the equality of Mathlib's Scheme.Hom.finrank with 2^k at every
point of the actual native Veronese Proj. It applies over every
field, to arbitrary coefficients including zero, for positive D
and source root counts at most 2D. In particular the geometric
flatness and constant-rank assertions do not require generic
square-class independence or characteristic zero.

The degree-one dehomogenization map has proved kernel generated
by b-1, and gives an actual ring equivalence from that quotient to
the homogeneous localization. The proof constructs the inverse
evaluation using the ordinary localization, where b maps to one.
A literal ring basis is transported to the quotient by tensor
base change, then through the constructed ring equivalences and
coefficient transport. This proves that a free graded ring map
has an actual free map on each degree-one chart, with basis the
dehomogenized original basis. Homogeneity of the original basis
is used for the explicit fraction formula, not assumed for the
base-change basis argument itself.

For the source, the exact chart basis vector is the previously
constructed normal basis vector divided by f(b) to its explicit
radical-count weight. Every nonzero native chart is a domain and
the actual source chart module is finite free of rank 2^k. The
base and source actions are the actual homogeneous-localization
map, not auxiliary actions assumed compatible.

The actual projective map is flat by those chart bases and Zariski
locality. Each chart square is proved to be a pullback. Mathlib's
finite-flat scheme rank is then computed on that pullback from
the literal chart basis. The proved degree-one target cover gives
constant rank everywhere, and its positive value proves
surjectivity. This establishes the projective cover rank, not
only the rank of its affine cone.

This extends P1-MATH-0106 without a new identifier. The geometric
base is still the actual standard Veronese Proj; its explicit
identification with the projective plane remains open. The
degree-zero function-field bridge and its identification with
the manuscript's generic field, Hilbert computation, surface
degree 2^k D^2, curve-degree identities and external host counts
remain open. The constant scheme rank does not replace those
separate alignment steps. T1.7 stays in_progress, numbered
coverage stays 79/167, confirmed improvements stay 106 and
Palomar remains deferred.

Source integrity: 138 manifest entries and all 167 numbered results. Ubuntu root free space 13.71 GiB.

These modules use the pinned Mathlib quotient tensor-product
equivalences, basis base change, flat ring and scheme criteria,
scheme chart pullbacks and finite-flat rank API. In particular the
rank is the existing Mathlib scheme definition, not a new function
defined to have the desired value. All compatibility maps and
their hypotheses are discharged on the actual source. No new
unproved literature input or Paper C port is introduced; additional
Mathlib dependencies are compiled selectively. Manuscript V1.6
is preserved byte for byte.


## Actual integral projective schemes and their function fields

The actual native base and the actual source projective schemes
are now proved integral under the source integrality hypotheses.
The base needs only a field and positive D. The source retains
characteristic zero, nonzero radicand coefficients, at least one
root in each equation and the exact pairwise disjoint root-set
hypotheses already used for its coordinate-domain proof. The
positive degree and root-count bounds supply its rescaled grading.
No domain or integrality assertion is assumed as a new interface.

For a graded domain, homogeneous localization at any submonoid
avoiding zero is proved a domain by its faithful embedding into
the ordinary localization. Every actual Proj stalk is consequently
a domain, and the scheme is reduced. If the irrelevant ideal is
nonzero, the literal zero homogeneous prime is constructed as a
point and proved generic. This proves irreducibility, nonemptiness
and integrality, and identifies the scheme's chosen generic point
with that zero prime.

The native coordinate powers X_j^D are constructed in the actual
standard Veronese algebra, with proved degree-one membership and
nonvanishing. The Z^D coordinate proves nonzero irrelevant ideals
for both the base and, by the faithful graded base inclusion, the
source. These facts discharge the nonempty-Proj hypotheses on the
literal algebras used for the projective cover.

The actual scheme function field is constructed as ring-equivalent
to the homogeneous localization at the zero ideal: fractions of
homogeneous numerators and nonzero denominators of the same degree.
The latter ring is proved a field. A faithful radical-admissible
graded map is proved to map the zero prime and generic point to
their actual counterparts. Its map of scheme function fields is
constructed directly from the scheme morphism's stalk map and
proved injective. The corresponding map on degree-zero homogeneous
fractions is also constructed. These constructions are instantiated
for the exact projective base inclusion of the source, retaining
all the stated source hypotheses.

The remaining alignment includes the compatibility of the two
function-field maps under these equivalences and identification
with the affine split-radical generic field in the manuscript.
The degree of that actual field extension is not yet certified by
the already proved constant scheme rank. The explicit base Proj
identification with the projective plane, Hilbert computation,
surface degree 2^k D^2, curve-degree identities and external host
counts remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress, coverage stays 79/167,
confirmed improvements stay 106 and Palomar remains deferred.

Source integrity: 138 manifest entries and all 167 numbered results. Ubuntu root free space 13.69 GiB.

The function field in these statements is Mathlib's existing
Scheme.functionField, the stalk of the actual generic point.
The proofs use the pinned Proj stalk isomorphism and the existing
scheme integrality and function-field API. The projective function
field map is the actual stalk map of the previously constructed
scheme morphism after the proved generic-point equality. No new
axiom, arithmetic estimate, Paper C port or original source edit
is introduced. Dependencies are compiled selectively on Ubuntu.


## Naturality of the actual projective function-field map

The map on actual scheme function fields is now proved compatible
with the map on actual degree-zero homogeneous fractions. The
function-field equivalences and the generic-point stalk map are
exposed as their categorical isomorphism and morphism, preserving
their previous ring types and constructions. Their commuting
diagram is a proved equality of actual ring homomorphisms.

The proof transports a scheme stalk map along proved equalities
of source and target points. A Proj stalk compatibility theorem
identifies it with the actual homogeneous local ring map after
that point transport. At the zero homogeneous primes, this is
exactly the degree-zero fraction map of the original graded ring
homomorphism. Applying the checked generic-point equalities gives
the categorical square and then the ring-homomorphism square.

For the paper's source, the separately constructed map induced by
the actual projective morphism is proved equal to the general
construction. The literal base and source function-field
equivalences then give the commuting diagram with the actual
graded base inclusion on homogeneous fractions. All source domain
and integrality hypotheses remain explicit and are discharged by
the previously proved source domain and nonempty-Proj results.

Thus the naturality part of the degree-zero function-field bridge
is complete. Identification with the manuscript's affine
split-radical generic tower and the numerical degree of this
actual field extension remain open. The explicit plane
identification, Hilbert computation, surface degree 2^k D^2,
curve-degree identities and external host counts also remain
open. T1.7 stays in_progress, coverage stays 79/167, confirmed
improvements stay 106 and Palomar remains deferred.
