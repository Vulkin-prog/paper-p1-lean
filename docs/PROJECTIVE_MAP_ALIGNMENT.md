# Actual projective scheme map

The actual rescaled standard-base inclusion now induces a constructed
morphism of schemes from the source Proj to the native standard
Veronese Proj. Its inverse image of every base basic open D(b) is
exactly the source basic open D(f(b)). This construction uses the
literal graded inclusion and the actual source quotient, rather
than an assumed projective model.

The admissibility criterion is proved: the source irrelevant ideal
is contained in the radical of the mapped base irrelevant ideal.
The source generators are proved to generate their actual ring;
the irrelevant ideal of a ring generated in degree one is proved
to be their ideal span. Each pure base generator lies in the mapped
base irrelevant ideal, while the square of each radical generator
lies there by its actual homogeneous radicand relation. These
arguments apply over every field, including zero radicand
coefficients, for positive D and root counts at most 2D.

The pinned Mathlib Proj functor takes the stronger condition
H_plus <= map(G_plus). The quadratic source supplies the sufficient
radical containment above. A local extension implements the point
map, its continuity, the structure-sheaf map and its locality on
stalks under that weaker condition, and bundles the resulting
Scheme.Hom. This is a library interface extension, not an error
in the manuscript or a new mathematical-change identifier.

Finiteness of the scheme morphism, identification of the base Proj
with the projective plane, the degree-zero function-field bridge,
the degree 2^k of the projective cover, surface degree 2^k D^2,
curve-degree identities and the external surface covering and
host counts remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress, numbered coverage
stays 79/167 and confirmed mathematical improvements stay 106.
No original manuscript source is changed. Palomar remains deferred.

## Upstream provenance and statement comparison

The generic scheme construction adapts
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/ProjectiveSpectrum/Functor.lean` at the
immutable Mathlib commit
`9d581dfff2e41de989072ea63abf3daf69311520`, matching Lean
`v4.36.0-rc2`. Upstream copyright (c) 2026 Kenny Lau and the Apache
2.0 license notice are retained in `Geometry/ProjRadicalMap.lean`;
the repository LICENSE is Apache 2.0. The dependency is unchanged.

The upstream hypothesis is containment of the source irrelevant
ideal in the mapped base irrelevant ideal. The local version takes
containment in its radical, proves the necessary contradiction at
every homogeneous prime, and makes the dependent point, sheaf and
stalk constructions use that proved point map. The actual source
module supplies this hypothesis by its checked quadratic equations.
No unproved algebraic-geometric input is introduced, and no further
Paper C source is reused. Compilation, axiom inspection and ledger
reference checks use the pinned rc2 toolchain.

## P1-MATH-0106 extended — Finiteness of the actual projective morphism

The constructed projective source morphism is now proved finite
as a morphism of schemes. This is the literal map from the source
Veronese Proj to the standard native Veronese Proj, not merely the
already verified finite map of affine cones. The theorem applies
over every field for arbitrary coefficients, positive D and root
counts at most 2D. Characteristic zero and root independence are
not required for finiteness.

For any nonnegatively graded commutative ring and any homogeneous
element b of degree one, a ring homomorphism to its degree-zero
homogeneous localization is constructed by sending each degree-n
component a to a/b^n. Compatibility with addition, multiplication
and one is proved, followed by its formula on homogeneous
elements, surjectivity and naturality for actual graded ring maps.
Surjectivity and naturality transport a finite total ring map to
a finite map of these actual chart rings, including degenerate
charts, without a nonzero or domain assumption.

The radical-admissible projective morphism is proved to restrict on
each degree-one basic open to the corresponding Spec map, under
the actual chart isomorphisms. Finiteness of that ring map proves
finiteness of each restricted scheme map. Degree-one base opens
cover the entire target by the proved irrelevant-ideal span
identity and generation in degree one. Zariski locality then
proves finiteness of the actual global projective morphism.

This extends the argument supporting P1-MATH-0106; no new
mathematical-change identifier is introduced. The cover's generic
degree, identification of the base Proj with the projective plane,
the degree-zero function-field bridge, the Hilbert calculation,
surface degree 2^k D^2, curve-degree identities and external host
counts remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress, coverage stays 79/167,
confirmed improvements stay 106 and Palomar remains deferred.

The first three proofs in `Geometry/ProjRadicalCharts.lean` adapt
the basic-open and localization compatibility proofs from the same
upstream Functor.lean file and pinned Mathlib commit recorded above.
The copyright and Apache 2.0 attribution are preserved. The new
dehomogenization and finiteness arguments are proved locally;
Mathlib's definition of finite scheme morphisms, its affine Spec
criterion and its Zariski locality supply the checked scheme API.
No external arithmetic estimate, original source change or further
Paper C port is introduced. Additional Mathlib dependencies were
compiled selectively, without downloading the full cache.


## P1-MATH-0106 extended — The actual finite flat cover has constant rank 2^k

The actual projective source morphism is now proved finite,
flat, surjective and of constant scheme rank 2^k. The rank statement
is the equality of Mathlib's Scheme.Hom.finrank with 2^k at every
point of the actual native Veronese Proj. It applies over every
field, to arbitrary coefficients including zero, for positive D
and source root counts at most 2D. In particular the geometric
flatness and constant-rank assertions do not require generic
square-class independence or characteristic zero.

The degree-one dehomogenization map has proved kernel generated
by b-1, and gives an actual ring equivalence from that quotient to
the homogeneous localization. The proof constructs the inverse
evaluation using the ordinary localization, where b maps to one.
A literal ring basis is transported to the quotient by tensor
base change, then through the constructed ring equivalences and
coefficient transport. This proves that a free graded ring map
has an actual free map on each degree-one chart, with basis the
dehomogenized original basis. Homogeneity of the original basis
is used for the explicit fraction formula, not assumed for the
base-change basis argument itself.

For the source, the exact chart basis vector is the previously
constructed normal basis vector divided by f(b) to its explicit
radical-count weight. Every nonzero native chart is a domain and
the actual source chart module is finite free of rank 2^k. The
base and source actions are the actual homogeneous-localization
map, not auxiliary actions assumed compatible.

The actual projective map is flat by those chart bases and Zariski
locality. Each chart square is proved to be a pullback. Mathlib's
finite-flat scheme rank is then computed on that pullback from
the literal chart basis. The proved degree-one target cover gives
constant rank everywhere, and its positive value proves
surjectivity. This establishes the projective cover rank, not
only the rank of its affine cone.

This extends P1-MATH-0106 without a new identifier. The geometric
base is still the actual standard Veronese Proj; its explicit
identification with the projective plane remains open. The
degree-zero function-field bridge and its identification with
the manuscript's generic field, Hilbert computation, surface
degree 2^k D^2, curve-degree identities and external host counts
remain open. The constant scheme rank does not replace those
separate alignment steps. T1.7 stays in_progress, numbered
coverage stays 79/167, confirmed improvements stay 106 and
Palomar remains deferred.

These modules use the pinned Mathlib quotient tensor-product
equivalences, basis base change, flat ring and scheme criteria,
scheme chart pullbacks and finite-flat rank API. In particular the
rank is the existing Mathlib scheme definition, not a new function
defined to have the desired value. All compatibility maps and
their hypotheses are discharged on the actual source. No new
unproved literature input or Paper C port is introduced; additional
Mathlib dependencies are compiled selectively. Manuscript V1.6
is preserved byte for byte.


## Actual integral projective schemes and their function fields

The actual native base and the actual source projective schemes
are now proved integral under the source integrality hypotheses.
The base needs only a field and positive D. The source retains
characteristic zero, nonzero radicand coefficients, at least one
root in each equation and the exact pairwise disjoint root-set
hypotheses already used for its coordinate-domain proof. The
positive degree and root-count bounds supply its rescaled grading.
No domain or integrality assertion is assumed as a new interface.

For a graded domain, homogeneous localization at any submonoid
avoiding zero is proved a domain by its faithful embedding into
the ordinary localization. Every actual Proj stalk is consequently
a domain, and the scheme is reduced. If the irrelevant ideal is
nonzero, the literal zero homogeneous prime is constructed as a
point and proved generic. This proves irreducibility, nonemptiness
and integrality, and identifies the scheme's chosen generic point
with that zero prime.

The native coordinate powers X_j^D are constructed in the actual
standard Veronese algebra, with proved degree-one membership and
nonvanishing. The Z^D coordinate proves nonzero irrelevant ideals
for both the base and, by the faithful graded base inclusion, the
source. These facts discharge the nonempty-Proj hypotheses on the
literal algebras used for the projective cover.

The actual scheme function field is constructed as ring-equivalent
to the homogeneous localization at the zero ideal: fractions of
homogeneous numerators and nonzero denominators of the same degree.
The latter ring is proved a field. A faithful radical-admissible
graded map is proved to map the zero prime and generic point to
their actual counterparts. Its map of scheme function fields is
constructed directly from the scheme morphism's stalk map and
proved injective. The corresponding map on degree-zero homogeneous
fractions is also constructed. These constructions are instantiated
for the exact projective base inclusion of the source, retaining
all the stated source hypotheses.

The remaining alignment includes the compatibility of the two
function-field maps under these equivalences and identification
with the affine split-radical generic field in the manuscript.
The degree of that actual field extension is not yet certified by
the already proved constant scheme rank. The explicit base Proj
identification with the projective plane, Hilbert computation,
surface degree 2^k D^2, curve-degree identities and external host
counts remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress, coverage stays 79/167,
confirmed improvements stay 106 and Palomar remains deferred.

Source integrity: 138 manifest entries and all 167 numbered results. Ubuntu root free space 13.69 GiB.

The function field in these statements is Mathlib's existing
Scheme.functionField, the stalk of the actual generic point.
The proofs use the pinned Proj stalk isomorphism and the existing
scheme integrality and function-field API. The projective function
field map is the actual stalk map of the previously constructed
scheme morphism after the proved generic-point equality. No new
axiom, arithmetic estimate, Paper C port or original source edit
is introduced. Dependencies are compiled selectively on Ubuntu.


## Naturality of the actual projective function-field map

The map on actual scheme function fields is now proved compatible
with the map on actual degree-zero homogeneous fractions. The
function-field equivalences and the generic-point stalk map are
exposed as their categorical isomorphism and morphism, preserving
their previous ring types and constructions. Their commuting
diagram is a proved equality of actual ring homomorphisms.

The proof transports a scheme stalk map along proved equalities
of source and target points. A Proj stalk compatibility theorem
identifies it with the actual homogeneous local ring map after
that point transport. At the zero homogeneous primes, this is
exactly the degree-zero fraction map of the original graded ring
homomorphism. Applying the checked generic-point equalities gives
the categorical square and then the ring-homomorphism square.

For the paper's source, the separately constructed map induced by
the actual projective morphism is proved equal to the general
construction. The literal base and source function-field
equivalences then give the commuting diagram with the actual
graded base inclusion on homogeneous fractions. All source domain
and integrality hypotheses remain explicit and are discharged by
the previously proved source domain and nonempty-Proj results.

Thus the naturality part of the degree-zero function-field bridge
is complete. Identification with the manuscript's affine
split-radical generic tower and the numerical degree of this
actual field extension remain open. The explicit plane
identification, Hilbert computation, surface degree 2^k D^2,
curve-degree identities and external host counts also remain
open. T1.7 stays in_progress, coverage stays 79/167, confirmed
improvements stay 106 and Palomar remains deferred.

## The actual projective function-field extension has degree 2^k

The actual extension of projective scheme function fields is now
proved finite of degree 2^k. Its algebra structure is the actual
stalk-induced map of the constructed source projective morphism.
By the previously proved naturality diagram, the actual map of
degree-zero homogeneous fraction fields has the same degree 2^k.
This computes the numerical field degree, separately from the
already proved constant finite-flat scheme rank.

For a nonzero degree-one homogeneous element b, its basic open
is proved nonempty by the actual zero homogeneous prime. The
chart map to the scheme function field is constructed by the
canonical localization-to-sections map followed by the actual
germ at the generic point. The scheme function field is proved
to be the fraction field of that chart ring, by its existing
affine-open fraction-field theorem and the actual chart section
isomorphism. No abstract field identification is assumed.

Naturality of these chart maps is proved first for germs and the
generic-point stalk map and then for the actual homogeneous
localization maps. This supplies both scalar-tower identities.
The fraction-ring dimension theorem equates the actual
function-field degree with the rank of the actual chart module.
The literal free chart basis therefore computes that field degree.

For the paper's source, the chart is the nonzero native Z^D
coordinate. The source chart basis and its index-cardinality
formula discharge the rank calculation as 2^k. The actual
geometric field extension is explicitly proved module-finite.
The checked ring equivalences and commuting diagram transport
the numerical degree to the actual homogeneous fraction-field
map. All source integrality hypotheses remain explicit:
characteristic zero, nonzero coefficients, nonempty root data,
pairwise disjoint root sets, the literal homogenized radicand
identities, positive D and the root-count degree bound.

Identification of these fields with the manuscript's explicit
affine split-radical generic tower remains open. The base target
is still the native standard Veronese Proj; its explicit plane
identification, the Hilbert/intersection calculation of surface
degree 2^k D^2, curve-degree identities and external host counts
remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress, numbered coverage stays
79/167, confirmed improvements stay 106 and Palomar remains
deferred. Original manuscript sources are unchanged.

## P1-MATH-0107 — Exact Hilbert function, polynomial and multiplicity of the actual source

The actual source homogeneous pieces now have explicit coefficient-field
bases and exact dimensions. If e ranges over the literal quadratic
normal-basis indices, and |e| is its proved radical-count weight, then

    h_S(n) = sum_{|e| <= n} binom(D(n-|e|)+2,2).

Every homogeneous piece is finite dimensional. For n >= k all normal
indices occur. The rational polynomial

    P_S(T) = (1/2) sum_e (DT-D|e|+1)(DT-D|e|+2)

is proved to equal these actual dimensions for every n >= k. Its
quadratic coefficient is 2^k D^2/2; for positive D its degree is exactly
two and its Hilbert multiplicity is 2^k D^2. This last invariant is
constructed from the unique eventual polynomial of the actual graded
pieces, not supplied as a premise or defined to be the target value.

The proof first restricts actual homogeneous vector bases to components.
The native standard Veronese basis consists of literal monomials.
The scalar-preserving literal base inclusion then composes that vector
basis with the actual relative free quadratic basis. Its component
indices are explicitly reindexed by radical weight and polynomial
exponents. Exponents of degree m are identified with symmetric powers,
giving the proved monomial count binom(m+2,2). The native base pieces
accordingly have dimension binom(nD+2,2).

All these dimension and Hilbert identities hold over any coefficient
field, including positive characteristic and zero radicand coefficients,
under the literal radicand identities, positive D and degree bound.
The separate characteristic-zero, nonzero-coefficient and root-disjointness
hypotheses remain necessary in the existing source-integrality argument.
This gives an elementary Hilbert-function proof of the numerical surface
factor appearing in Step 2, and a stronger exact formula for a revision.

The invariant computed here is the Hilbert multiplicity of the actual
chosen graded presentation. A scheme-theoretic comparison with the
manuscript's explicit projective embedding and hyperplane bundle, the
native target's identification with the plane, the curve-degree
projection formula and the external surface/curve host counts remain
open. The explicit affine generic-tower identification is also still
open. T1.7 remains in_progress and numbered coverage remains 79/167.
Confirmed mathematical improvements now total 107; no manuscript
conclusion error has been confirmed. Palomar remains deferred.
Original manuscript sources are unchanged.

## Actual projective charts and function fields match the literal affine system

The actual native and source Z-charts are now identified with the
literal affine rings in the manuscript. The native chart is the
polynomial plane F[X][X]. The source chart is the actual iterated
quadratic algebra with radicands c_i prod(X+a) prod(Y+b), indexed by
the original finite list. Scheme isomorphisms identify the actual
basic-open subschemes with the spectra of these rings.

The construction first proves, for any graded commutative coefficient
algebra and positive D, that its rescaled Veronese chart at b^D is
isomorphic to the original homogeneous chart at b. The literal map
uses dehomogenization and the quotient by b^D-1; its injectivity and
surjectivity are proved by clearing powers of b. No domain hypothesis
is used, and rings with zero divisors are included.

For the quadratic tower, coefficient specialization is proved
surjective when the base specialization is surjective, with kernel
exactly the extended base kernel. Specializing the homogenizing
variable to one has exactly the principal kernel (Z-1), both in the
coefficient ring and in the actual source coordinate quotient.
This produces the affine chart isomorphism without assuming a
geometric identification. The actual base variables and radical
generators are proved to map to their literal affine counterparts.
These ring and chart computations allow any coefficient field and
zero coefficients, under the explicit radicand identities and degree
bound used to construct the grading.

Under the separate existing source-integrality hypotheses, the
canonical scheme function fields are now explicitly isomorphic to
F(X,Y) and the affine generic split-radical tower. The proof uses the
canonical chart-to-generic-stalk map and its actual fraction-field
property, together with the previously verified affine generic tower
fraction-field theorem. The actual projective function-field map
commutes with these two explicit isomorphisms and the literal base
field inclusion. Naturality is proved on dehomogenized chart elements
and extended to the full fields by the localization universal property.
This closes the previously open affine generic-tower identification.

The native target's global projective-plane identification, the
comparison of the chosen graded presentation with the explicit
projective embedding and hyperplane bundle, the curve-degree
projection formula and the external surface/curve host counts remain
open. The source Hilbert multiplicity 2^k D^2, finite-flat rank 2^k
and actual function-field degree 2^k remain previously checked facts.

## Global standard projective-plane target and finite flat source projection

The native standard Veronese projective target is now globally
isomorphic to the standard projective plane, defined as Proj of the
ordinary homogeneous grading on F[X_0,X_1,X_2]. This is an actual
scheme isomorphism, constructed from the literal Veronese inclusion.
Composing it with the existing source morphism gives the actual
projection to that plane. This projection is proved finite, flat,
surjective and of constant scheme rank 2^k at every plane point.
These cover statements allow arbitrary coefficient fields and zero
radicand coefficients; the separate source-integrality hypotheses
remain explicit for function-field assertions.

The underlying general theorem proves Proj invariance under every
positive Veronese construction on an internally graded commutative
coefficient algebra. No domain, reducedness, characteristic-zero,
Noetherian or generation-in-degree-one hypothesis is used. The
inclusion multiplies the grading by D, so it is handled by a verified
positive-degree-scaling Proj functor, not incorrectly treated as a
same-degree graded homomorphism. Homogeneous ideal pullback is
justified by a proved projection identity; actual homogeneous
localization and local-ring maps multiply fraction degrees by D.

For admissibility, a positive-degree homogeneous element has its Dth
power in the positive part of the actual Veronese. The necessary
irrelevant-ideal containment therefore holds in the radical. On
every positive homogeneous chart the actual ring map is proved
bijective: all relevant numerator degrees are already multiples
of D. Local scheme chart compatibility and locality of being an
isomorphism then prove the global isomorphism. The point map,
structure sheaf maps and generic local-ring locality are constructed
and checked, rather than supplied as an abstract isomorphism premise.

The scaled-localization and Proj chart constructions adapt the
pinned Mathlib source with its Kenny Lau copyright and Apache 2.0
attribution preserved in the new modules. The upstream files and
pinned dependency are unchanged.

This closes the previously open global projective-plane target
identification. The numerical Hilbert multiplicity 2^k D^2, explicit
affine generic-field identifications and actual function-field
degree 2^k remain checked. Comparison with the chosen projective
embedding and hyperplane bundle, the curve-degree projection
formula, low-degree curve geometry and external surface/curve
point counts remain open. T1.7 remains in_progress, numbered

## Actual closed projective embedding, coordinate quotient and Hilbert degree

The actual source now has the closed projective immersion defined
by precisely its degree-D base monomials and radical coordinates.
The ambient scheme is the standard Proj of the ordinary polynomial
ring on that literal coordinate index. An explicit bijection
identifies the index with the disjoint union of ternary degree-D
exponents and the original radical indices. Its cardinality is
binom(D+2,2)+k, giving the manuscript ambient coordinate count.

The polynomial evaluation map to the actual source Veronese is
constructed, proved surjective and proved to preserve every
homogeneous degree. Its irrelevant-ideal admissibility follows
from the actual degree-one generators. Surjectivity descends to
all degree-one affine chart maps by dehomogenization. Their actual
spectrum maps are closed immersions, and the checked chart
compatibility proves the global source map is a closed immersion.
No closed-immersion premise is supplied as an external input.

The homogeneous coordinate ideal is exactly the kernel of that
same polynomial evaluation map. It is proved homogeneous. Its
literal polynomial quotient has the grading whose pieces are the
images of the ordinary homogeneous polynomial pieces. The actual
quotient algebra is proved isomorphic to the source Veronese, and
every graded piece is identified by a linear equivalence.
Thus the coordinate quotient and grading used in the Hilbert
calculation match the verified chosen projective presentation.

Every coordinate piece is finite dimensional. The previously
computed exact source Hilbert function and unique eventual
quadratic polynomial are transported to these actual coordinate
pieces. Their Hilbert multiplicity is proved to be 2^k D^2.
The closed immersion and this numerical multiplicity are bundled
in one checked statement. This computes the Hilbert degree in the
manuscript's explicit projective coordinates, rather than only an
invariant of an unidentified graded algebra.

The structural embedding permits arbitrary coefficient fields and
zero coefficients under the explicit degree bound and positive D.
The Hilbert formula retains the literal original radicand identities.
The separate source-integrality hypotheses are unchanged for
function-field arguments. The hyperplane-bundle pullback comparison,
curve-degree projection formula, low-degree curve geometry, a
scheme-dimension comparison and external surface/curve point counts
remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress, numbered coverage remains

deferred. Original manuscript sources are unchanged.

## Plane-equation quotient and actual Veronese Hilbert degree

For the literal quotient F[X,Y,Z]/(f), with nonzero homogeneous f
of degree e, multiplication by f is an injective map from the
ordinary degree-n piece to the degree-(n+e) piece. Its actual range
is exactly the kernel of the homogeneous quotient map. Rank-nullity
and the proved monomial bases therefore give
h(n+e)+binom(n+2,2)=binom(n+e+2,2).
Every quotient piece is finite dimensional. Its unique eventual
Hilbert polynomial is eT+(3e-e^2)/2. For positive e its degree is
one and its Hilbert multiplicity is e.

For any internally graded algebra over a field, the actual rescaled
D-th Veronese piece is proved linearly equivalent to the original
degree-nD piece. For positive D, any established Hilbert polynomial
P becomes P(DT); its multiplicity is multiplied by D^(deg P).
These are proved from the actual pieces and polynomial composition.
Applying this to the literal plane-equation quotient gives Hilbert
degree De for its D-th Veronese, with its quotient and Veronese
gradings explicitly constructed.

These calculations hold over any coefficient field. The plane
Hilbert identities require neither irreducibility nor reducedness
of f, only f nonzero and homogeneous; positivity of e and D is
explicit when claiming degree one or Veronese rescaling. No general
Hilbert-polynomial existence theorem is assumed.

This proves the target plane-curve factor De needed in Step 2.
The remaining comparison with the Hilbert degree of an arbitrary
integral curve in the actual source still requires the finite
graded-module rank formula and its degree-zero field comparison.
The full curve projection-degree formula, scheme-dimension and
hyperplane-bundle comparisons, low-degree curve geometry and
external host-count inputs remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress,
numbered coverage remains 79/167 and confirmed improvements remain
107. Palomar remains deferred; original sources are unchanged.

## Actual graded curve quotients, finite module rank and Hilbert comparison

The finite graded-module comparison is now constructed from actual
homogeneous generators. The component map sends a tuple of coefficients
in degrees n-w_i to the actual sum of their images times the generators.
Projection onto homogeneous components proves surjectivity for a
generating family; actual module independence proves injectivity.
Both dimension inequalities follow from checked linear maps.

A maximal independent subfamily of finite generators is selected using
the pinned Mathlib theorem, with a common nonzero module denominator.
A nonzero homogeneous component of that denominator gives an injection
from each sufficiently high target piece into the range of a shifted
free component map. The reverse injection comes from independence.
Thus the actual target Hilbert function is squeezed between the sums
of the source functions at n-w_i and n+m-w_i. The subfamily cardinality
is proved equal to the actual module finrank, and also to the rank of
compatible fraction-field extensions, rather than supplied as a premise.

If the base function is eventually an+b, the target function differs
from rank*a*n by a bounded rational error. This numerical slope is
proved unique. Any polynomial eventually equal to a function with
that bounded error must be affine: a nonconstant remaining polynomial
would have unbounded absolute evaluations on natural arguments.
Consequently, if a target Hilbert polynomial exists and a is positive,
its degree is proved to be one and its Hilbert multiplicity equals
rank*a. Neither the polynomial degree nor the multiplicity identity
is assumed. General existence of the target polynomial remains an
explicit ordinary theorem argument, with no new axiom.

The actual quotient by any homogeneous ideal is supplied with its
image grading, decomposition, projection maps and graded quotient map.
An actual graded algebra map descends to the quotient by a target
ideal and its actual preimage. The descended map is injective, and
the given finite homogeneous module generators descend literally.

These constructions are instantiated for homogeneous prime quotients

preimage quotient are domains, their actual pieces are finite

## Actual projective curve quotient function-field rank

The finite graded-module rank is now identified with the degree of
the actual projective function-field map. This comparison is proved
through literal degree-one affine charts, with no Laurent-polynomial
identification or cone-field degree supplied as a premise.

The common denominator of an independent homogeneous free approximation
can be chosen homogeneous and nonzero. Every component of an arbitrary
clearing denominator still clears the entire module: the proof handles
both the allowed-degree terms and the terms below a generator weight,
then recomposes an arbitrary element from its homogeneous components.

For a nonzero degree-one chart coordinate, dehomogenization is injective
on each homogeneous component of a domain. Every chart element has
representatives in all sufficiently large degrees. For a finite family
of chart coefficients, their representative degrees can be adjusted
simultaneously against the actual generator weights. Thus a relation
between the dehomogenized independent generators lifts to a single
homogeneous relation in the original module, proving chart independence.
Actual finite generators and the homogeneous denominator descend by
the checked dehomogenization diagram. The same independent subfamily
therefore computes both the global module rank and the chart-module
rank. Their equality is proved, rather than assumed.

The actual generic-point function fields are already proved to be the
fraction fields of these charts. Their checked naturality and the
pinned fraction-field rank theorem identify the degree of the actual
scheme function-field map with the chart rank, hence with the global
finite graded-module rank.

Irrelevant ideals commute with surjective graded maps. The actual
irrelevant-ideal radical bound is proved to descend to a homogeneous
target quotient and its actual base preimage quotient. This constructs
the projective morphism between the literal source prime quotient and
its literal base quotient. A nonzero degree-one base coordinate proves
both projective spectra nonempty and integral. Their actual geometric
function-field map is constructed and its degree is proved equal to
the already computed source-quotient module rank, between 1 and 2^k.
The source Hilbert multiplicity comparison is restated using this
actual projective field degree, still with the target Hilbert-polynomial
existence and the actual affine base polynomial as explicit arguments.

This closes the module-to-projective-function-field rank comparison
for these actual quotients. The full manuscript curve formula still
requires general Hilbert-polynomial existence for the curve quotients
and identification of the base image quotient with the literal
plane-equation Veronese, whose Hilbert degree De is already checked.
Scheme dimension, hyperplane-bundle comparison, low-degree curve
geometry and external host-count inputs remain open. T1.7 stays
in_progress; numbered coverage remains 79/167, confirmed improvements
remain 107 and Palomar remains deferred. Original sources are unchanged.

## Hilbert-polynomial existence from two actual parameters

Hilbert-polynomial existence is now proved for an internally graded
F-algebra domain finite over two actual degree-one parameters, with
finite-dimensional homogeneous pieces. Finite module generation, rather
than a Hilbert-polynomial existence premise, is the input.

A homogeneous polynomial in one variable is its actual coefficient
times the corresponding monomial. After the degrees of finitely many
homogeneous generators, multiplication by that parameter is surjective
on consecutive module pieces. Their finite dimensions decrease and
therefore eventually stabilize. This proves an actual constant Hilbert
polynomial for any such one-parameter module, including rings with
zero divisors.

For two parameters, the actual homogeneous quotient by the first
parameter is generated over the second. The polynomial coefficient
map that kills the first variable is constructed and checked. The
quotient Hilbert function therefore stabilizes. If the first parameter
is nonzero in the domain, the checked hyperplane exact sequence gives
an affine Hilbert function by a natural-number recurrence. If it is
zero, the original Hilbert function is already eventually constant.
Both cases produce actual rational Hilbert polynomials. Finally, finite
module generation yields a finite homogeneous generating family by
taking the finitely many components of actual finite generators.

The theorem still needs a checked two-parameter finite normalization
for the actual curve quotients. Identification of the base image
quotient with the literal plane-equation Veronese remains open, as do
scheme dimension, hyperplane-bundle comparison, low-degree geometry
and external host-count inputs. No manuscript result is counted as
complete on the basis of this general algebraic step. Coverage stays
79/167 and the confirmed mathematical-improvement count stays 107.

## Literal Veronese quotients and plane-equation Hilbert degree

The literal Veronese construction now commutes with quotient by a
homogeneous ideal, after contracting that ideal along the inclusion.
A graded map is restricted to the actual Veronese subalgebras. Its
surjectivity follows by lifting each homogeneous component, rather
than by assuming surjectivity after restriction. The restricted
quotient kernel is proved equal to the contracted ideal. The actual
quotient isomorphism identifies every rescaled homogeneous piece,
including its vector-space dimension.

For a nonzero homogeneous plane equation f of degree e, this constructs
an isomorphism from the native Veronese quotient by the contracted
principal ideal (f) to the literal D-th Veronese of F[X,Y,Z]/(f).
The native quotient therefore has the actual affine Hilbert polynomial
De*T + (3e-e^2)/2 and Hilbert multiplicity De when D,e are positive.
This identifies actual quotient pieces; no Hilbert-degree comparison
is supplied as an assumption.

The remaining geometric step is to extract the homogeneous plane
equation and prove that the actual image prime ideal is its contracted
principal ideal. The Veronese/quotient algebra comparison needed once
that equality is established is now proved. Finite two-parameter
normalization for actual source curve quotients, scheme dimension,
hyperplane-bundle comparison, low-degree geometry and external host
counts remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress, numbered coverage stays
79/167, confirmed mathematical improvements stay 107, and Palomar
remains deferred. Original sources are unchanged.

## Finite plane normalization and actual source curve degree

Finite two-parameter normalization is now constructed over an infinite
field for an actual homogeneous plane quotient containing a nonzero
homogeneous relation. A checked scaling identity proves nonvanishing
somewhere on the fixed projective affine patch X0=1. An explicit
invertible linear shear preserves every homogeneous degree and makes
the first-variable leading coefficient a nonzero scalar. Its monic
normalization and the actual polynomial quotient isomorphism prove
module finiteness over the remaining linear coordinates.

A polynomial algebra is proved finite over its positive coordinate
powers: each coordinate is integral over its power, and the actual
finite coordinate family generates the algebra. For an algebra already
finite over linear parameters, their D-th powers give a finite action
on the actual ambient algebra. Its literal Veronese embeds linearly
into that finite module over a Noetherian polynomial ring, so it is
finite too. The same parameters are proved to have rescaled degree one.
This supplies actual finite parameters, rather than assuming them.

Finite parameters transfer through the checked Veronese quotient
isomorphism and through actual finite graded maps. The actual source
prime quotient map is constructed as an F-algebra map and is proved
finite from its existing homogeneous generators. Hence it inherits
finite parameters and an actual Hilbert polynomial from its native
base quotient.

When the actual base ideal is the contraction of the principal ideal
of a nonzero homogeneous plane equation f of positive degree e, the
native base has the explicit affine Hilbert polynomial
De*T+(3e-e^2)/2, and source Hilbert-polynomial existence is now proved
from that ideal equality. Neither Hilbert existence nor an assumed
Hilbert slope remains a separate input. The actual source Hilbert
multiplicity is proved equal to D*e times the degree of the actual
projective function-field map between the literal quotient Proj schemes.
The stored public theorem states this literal field finrank, verified
by inspecting its elaborated type and kernel axioms.

This discharges the Hilbert-existence and Veronese-quotient comparison
steps for an identified plane-equation image. Extracting that equation
from the actual geometric curve image prime remains open; the image
ideal equality is still an explicit premise. Scheme dimension,
hyperplane-bundle comparison, low-degree geometry and external host
counts remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress, coverage stays 79/167,
confirmed improvements stay 107, and Palomar remains deferred.

## Actual source prime heights and extracted plane-equation degree

The actual homogeneous prime ideals now pass through the checked
Veronese projective isomorphism. Its underlying point equivalence is
constructed, and the contraction of its inverse prime is proved to be
the original Veronese prime. For an actual source prime quotient, a
nonzero degree-one base quotient coordinate constructs its projective
base prime. Its inverse gives an actual homogeneous prime in the
ordinary three-variable plane ring, with contraction exactly equal to
the actual base ideal.

A nonzero principal homogeneous polynomial ideal is proved to have a
homogeneous generator. The proof takes a nonzero homogeneous component
of a generator. Divisibility by the generator and additivity of total
degree force the quotient to be a nonzero constant. The generator is
therefore a scalar multiple of that homogeneous component. For a proper
ideal its degree is positive. The pinned UFD height-one theorem then
produces a positive-degree homogeneous generator of a height-one prime;
primality of the principal ideal proves the generator irreducible.

Prime contraction is strictly increasing along chains under integral
maps. The actual height inequality is proved using order height. With
going down, chains lift and the heights are equal. The actual source
projection has both properties: its checked finite free basis supplies
integrality and flatness, hence going down. Therefore the actual source
prime and its native base contraction have equal heights. Every positive
Veronese inclusion is also proved integral by taking D-th powers of
homogeneous elements and recomposing arbitrary elements. The lifted
ordinary plane prime has height at most the native base prime. If the
source prime has height one, its base contraction is nonzero of height
one, so the lifted ordinary plane prime is nonzero and has height one.

Consequently a height-one actual source prime supplies its own
homogeneous irreducible plane equation and the exact contracted-ideal
equality. Over an infinite field, source Hilbert-polynomial existence
then follows from the preceding finite-normalization proof. The actual
source Hilbert multiplicity equals D times the extracted equation degree
times the actual projective function-field degree. The final theorem
assumes neither a plane equation, an image ideal equality, an image-height
condition, a Hilbert polynomial nor a slope. The source-height-one input
and a nonzero degree-one base quotient coordinate remain explicit.

The algebraic image-equation extraction is thus complete in this
source-height-one formulation. A separate statement-alignment step must
relate the manuscript's geometric dimension-one curve condition to that
source prime height, and compare the actual Hilbert multiplicity with
the intrinsic hyperplane degree. Low-degree geometry and external host
counts remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress, coverage stays 79/167,
confirmed improvements stay 107 and Palomar remains deferred. Original
manuscript sources are unchanged.

## Actual projective curve points and their constructed chart coordinates

The source curve degree theorem now takes an actual projective source
point and the height-one condition on its homogeneous prime. The point
itself supplies primality, homogeneity, and relevance. Its image under
the actual source projection is a relevant native Veronese prime.

For any internally graded algebra generated in degree one, relevance
of a quotient ideal is proved to yield a nonzero degree-one quotient
coordinate: otherwise all degree-one generators would lie in the ideal,
forcing it to contain the irrelevant ideal. The native base satisfies
the required generation theorem. An actual nonzero base coordinate is
therefore constructed from the source projective point and its actual
projection. No coordinate witness is a separate theorem input.

The resulting theorem constructs the homogeneous irreducible plane
equation, proves the actual base ideal equals its contracted principal
ideal, proves source Hilbert-polynomial existence, and identifies the
actual source Hilbert multiplicity with D times the extracted plane
equation degree times the actual projective function-field degree.
The stored public statement uses literal quotient Proj function fields;
its elaborated type and kernel axioms are inspected directly.

The remaining statement-alignment steps concern the geometric curve
dimension versus homogeneous prime height and intrinsic hyperplane
degree versus the actual coordinate Hilbert multiplicity. Low-degree
curve geometry and the external uniform host counts remain open.

## Actual small-degree curves and degree-one function-field square descent

For an actual height-one projective source point, source Hilbert
multiplicity below 2D now forces a homogeneous linear irreducible
plane-image equation and actual projective function-field degree one.
The proof uses the already established literal degree formula and the
positive integer factors; it assumes no line equation or birationality.

A degree-one field extension is proved to be an actual algebra
isomorphism and to reflect squares and quadratic roots. The generic
finite graded-map rank comparison is used to construct the isomorphism
of its actual projective function fields when module rank is one.
This is specialized to the actual source-point projection. The public
square-reflection theorem concerns the literal quotient Proj function
fields and their actual scalar map. It requires no infinite-field
assumption. The public elaborated types and kernel axioms are inspected
directly. Instance-preserving generic specialization avoids rebuilding
large stalk-map expressions in handwritten source-point field types.

Thus a source curve below 2D has the linear image and degree-one field
map needed for the next exclusion step. The existing functional-square
line obstruction still needs the checked affine line parametrization
and the actual curve-coordinate/function-field diagram before it can
exclude all such curves through admissible hosts. This geometric
exclusion is not claimed here. Geometric dimension/prime-height and
intrinsic hyperplane-degree/Hilbert-multiplicity alignment, higher
low-degree geometry, and the external uniform host counts remain open.

## Actual radical descent, affine quotient charts, and graph-line exclusion

The literal homogeneous radical equations are now proved in the actual
source and base curve quotients. For a finite graded projection of rank
one, these equations descend to squares in the actual projective base
function field on any nonzero degree-one chart. This is specialized to
an actual projective source point and its actual degree-one field map.

For any surjective graded map, the kernel of the actual degree-one
chart map is proved to be the image of the graded-map kernel under
dehomogenization. The actual native Veronese quotient Z-chart is thereby
identified with the affine polynomial-plane quotient. Contracting a
homogeneous principal plane ideal and then taking this chart gives
exactly the principal ideal of its affine equation, for any homogeneous
equation degree and any positive Veronese degree.

For a plane-image ideal whose affine equation is Y = alpha X + beta,
the actual base chart is constructed as a polynomial ring in one
variable. Its nonzero chart coordinate follows from the image-ideal
condition. The chart equivalence sends every literal radicand to exactly
the line-restriction polynomial used in the proved square obstruction.
The actual source degree-one projection therefore produces functional
squares in the ordinary rational function field, without separate
square or coordinate-diagram assumptions. Over the rationals, the
admissible-host square-class and disjoint-support hypotheses contradict
this. An actual height-one source curve with such a graph-line image
through an admissible host has Hilbert multiplicity at least 2D.

The graph-line image ideal and host-on-line conditions remain explicit.
The classification of an arbitrary homogeneous linear image into a
graph or vertical line, and the corresponding actual vertical-chart
diagram, remain open. So do geometric dimension/prime-height and
intrinsic hyperplane-degree/Hilbert-multiplicity alignment, higher
low-degree geometry, and external uniform host counts. T1.7 remains
in_progress, coverage stays 79/167, confirmed improvements stay 107,
and Palomar remains deferred. Original sources are unchanged.

## Actual full low-degree exclusion through affine source points

The actual vertical base-curve chart is now constructed as a polynomial
ring in one variable. Its equivalence sends each literal radicand to
the polynomial used in the existing vertical functional-square
obstruction. Degree-one projection of the actual source curve gives
these functional squares, without separate square or chart-coordinate
assumptions. The admissible-host hypotheses exclude this projection.

A homogeneous polynomial of degree one is proved to equal its literal
linear coefficient form. On the native Z-chart, a nonzero such equation
through an affine point is classified exhaustively as a graph line
through that point or the corresponding vertical line, including the
horizontal case. Multiplication by the appropriate nonzero scalar is
proved to preserve the exact principal ideal.

Combining this classification, the previously established actual curve
degree formula, and both actual chart-square diagrams proves the full
coordinate-algebraic version of Step 3: an actual height-one projective
source curve whose affine image contains an admissible rational host
has Hilbert multiplicity at least 2D. No line, plane equation,
birationality, or functional-square witness is an input. Both block
independence conditions, direct sum, nonzero coefficients, at least two
equations, and both disjoint nonempty support families are explicit.

The containment condition is also proved from an actual affine point
of the split-radical source with its literal base evaluation and an
actual source-curve ideal contained in that point's evaluation kernel.
The actual affine source point restricts to a map on the homogeneous
source Veronese ring, and its base image is proved to be the literal
affine host evaluation. Thus the projection/point containment diagram
is checked, rather than an independent assumption in the degree bound.

The previously open vertical diagram and linear-image classification
are discharged. Geometric curve dimension versus source prime height
and intrinsic hyperplane degree versus coordinate Hilbert multiplicity
still require statement alignment. Higher low-degree curve geometry
and external surface/curve uniform point counts remain open. T1.7
stays in_progress, coverage stays 79/167, confirmed mathematical
improvements stay 107, and Palomar remains deferred. Original sources
are unchanged.
