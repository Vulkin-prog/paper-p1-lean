# Actual projective scheme map

The actual rescaled standard-base inclusion now induces a constructed
morphism of schemes from the source Proj to the native standard
Veronese Proj. Its inverse image of every base basic open D(b) is
exactly the source basic open D(f(b)). This construction uses the
literal graded inclusion and the actual source quotient, rather
than an assumed projective model.

The admissibility criterion is proved: the source irrelevant ideal
is contained in the radical of the mapped base irrelevant ideal.
The source generators are proved to generate their actual ring;
the irrelevant ideal of a ring generated in degree one is proved
to be their ideal span. Each pure base generator lies in the mapped
base irrelevant ideal, while the square of each radical generator
lies there by its actual homogeneous radicand relation. These
arguments apply over every field, including zero radicand
coefficients, for positive D and root counts at most 2D.

The pinned Mathlib Proj functor takes the stronger condition
H_plus <= map(G_plus). The quadratic source supplies the sufficient
radical containment above. A local extension implements the point
map, its continuity, the structure-sheaf map and its locality on
stalks under that weaker condition, and bundles the resulting
Scheme.Hom. This is a library interface extension, not an error
in the manuscript or a new mathematical-change identifier.

Finiteness of the scheme morphism, identification of the base Proj
with the projective plane, the degree-zero function-field bridge,
the degree 2^k of the projective cover, surface degree 2^k D^2,
curve-degree identities and the external surface covering and
host counts remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress, numbered coverage
stays 79/167 and confirmed mathematical improvements stay 106.
No original manuscript source is changed. Palomar remains deferred.

## Upstream provenance and statement comparison

The generic scheme construction adapts
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/ProjectiveSpectrum/Functor.lean` at the
immutable Mathlib commit
`9d581dfff2e41de989072ea63abf3daf69311520`, matching Lean
`v4.36.0-rc2`. Upstream copyright (c) 2026 Kenny Lau and the Apache
2.0 license notice are retained in `Geometry/ProjRadicalMap.lean`;
the repository LICENSE is Apache 2.0. The dependency is unchanged.

The upstream hypothesis is containment of the source irrelevant
ideal in the mapped base irrelevant ideal. The local version takes
containment in its radical, proves the necessary contradiction at
every homogeneous prime, and makes the dependent point, sheaf and
stalk constructions use that proved point map. The actual source
module supplies this hypothesis by its checked quadratic equations.
No unproved algebraic-geometric input is introduced, and no further
Paper C source is reused. Compilation, axiom inspection and ledger
reference checks use the pinned rc2 toolchain.

Verified with Lean v4.36.0-rc2: full build 11821 jobs, direct axiom audit of 8089 theorem/lemma declarations using only propext, Classical.choice and Quot.sound, and 5799 distinct ledger declaration references. Source integrity: 138 manifest entries and all 167 numbered results. Ubuntu root free space 13.95 GiB.

Audit discovery also includes theorem and lemma attributes on the same
line as their declaration. This adds seven older auxiliary declarations
to direct axiom inspection, along with all twelve declarations in this
checkpoint; it changes neither mathematical statements nor coverage.
