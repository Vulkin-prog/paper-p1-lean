# Multiquadratic split radicands: exact square-class independence

The square-class independence assertion at the beginning of Step 1
of companion T1.7 is now proved literally. Let F be ANY field of
characteristic zero, and use the fraction field of F[X][Y]. For a
family of integer root lists I_i,J_i, pairwise disjoint within each
coordinate list, and arbitrary nonzero constants c_i in F, the actual
square classes of
  c_i * product_(a in I_i)(X+a) * product_(b in J_i)(Y+b)
are linearly independent over F_2 whenever I_i or J_i is nonempty
for each i. The index type can be arbitrary; linear independence is
checked on every finite subfamily. In particular this applies over
an algebraically closed characteristic-zero base, not just over Q.

The proof uses the existing internal reflection of squares from a
fraction field to its integrally closed polynomial ring. Passing to
one coordinate fraction field makes the scalar and the other split
factor units; the remaining nonempty split factor is separable and
not a unit, so its product with this nonzero scalar is not a square.
Swapping coordinates covers an empty root list on either side.
Exact product identities identify a finite subfamily product with
the nonzero product scalar times the split word on the two literal
unions of its disjoint root lists. Every nonempty subfamily product
is therefore nonsquare. The existing actual field square-class
quotient and a proved binary coefficient argument turn this into
literal F_2 linear independence. Nonzero radicands are proved too.

There is no smoothness or coefficient-height hypothesis in this
algebraic assertion. These hypotheses were already unnecessary for
the source independence argument, so no new mathematical-improvement
identifier is assigned. This adds the checked algebraic independence
part of Step 1, rather than a multiquadratic surface point count.
The general coordinate-ring freeness, field/localization and finite
birational projection arguments, the surface covering, curve-degree
exclusions and the two-variable estimates remain open. T1.7 stays
in_progress, coverage stays 79/167 and confirmed improvements stay
104. No external determinant estimate is treated as proved, and no
dependency download, original source change or Palomar registration
is introduced.

## The literal multiquadratic generic field and its degree

The generic multiquadratic field in Step 1 of companion T1.7 is now
constructed internally and proved to have degree 2^k. This advances
the previously checked square-class independence to a literal field
construction, rather than postulating an abstract extension degree.
For every commutative base ring and finite radicand list, a recursively
defined tower of actual quadratic algebras has an explicit free basis
indexed by one binary choice per equation. Over a nontrivial base its
finite rank is 2^k. The base embedding is proved injective, each actual
radical generator squares to its specified base radicand, and those
generators generate the entire algebra. A structural induction
principle is proved on the literal tower.

Over a characteristic-zero field, an exact one-step criterion says
that a base element g becomes square after adjoining sqrt(f), f!=0,
if and only if g or f*g is square in the base. This includes the
reducible one-step algebra as well. Induction proves a full descent
criterion for an independent radicand list: a base element g becomes
square exactly when g times the product of some selected sublist is
square in the original field. If every nonempty selected sublist has
nonsquare product, each successive radical remains nonsquare and the
literal tower is a field. No fieldhood or extension degree is assumed.

The source application uses the actual scaled split radicands over
Frac(F[X][Y]), for every characteristic-zero field F. Pairwise disjoint
integer root lists, at least one nonempty root list per equation, and
arbitrary nonzero constants prove the required sublist condition by
the already checked nonsquare finite-product theorem. Every finite
list of distinct equations therefore gives an actual generic field
of degree 2^k. This remains true when F is algebraically closed; no
smoothness or coefficient-height hypothesis enters this algebraic
step.

The explicit coordinate-ring quotient presentation and its embedding
in this generic field, the finite birational sum-of-radicals projection,
the projective and curve-degree arguments and the two-variable point
counts remain open. Thus this is further checked algebraic groundwork
for T1.7, not completion of the geometric count. T1.7 stays in_progress,
coverage stays 79/167 and improvements stay 104; the source already
uses this algebraic argument, so no new improvement identifier is
assigned. No external counting input, dependency download, original
manuscript change or Palomar registration is introduced.

## The actual coordinate domain and the finite affine radical-sum projection

The actual split-radical coordinate algebra in Step 1 of companion
T1.7 is now proved to be a domain, and the affine sum-of-radicals
projection is proved finite. The construction continues to work over
every characteristic-zero base field F, including an algebraic closure.
It uses the literal tower over F[X][Y] of the actual scaled split
polynomials, rather than assuming geometric integrality of a surface.

First, the tower has its exact universal property. For every base
ring homomorphism R->A and every actual family x_i in A satisfying
x_i^2=phi(f_i), there exists a unique ring homomorphism from the
tower to A that agrees with phi on the base and sends each actual
radical generator to x_i. The corresponding algebra-point equivalence
is also constructed. An explicit two-coordinate quadratic ring map,
its uniqueness and a recursive lift prove this, including empty
systems and arbitrary commutative target algebras. Thus the tower
represents precisely the simultaneous polynomial equations. Evaluation
at actual values X,Y specializes this statement to the source split
system; the scaled-word evaluation formula is checked explicitly.

Next, an actual recursive base-change homomorphism is constructed for
every ring homomorphism R->S. It is proved to commute with the base
embeddings, and it is injective whenever the base homomorphism is.
The quadratic step keeps the literal new parameter and the proved
coefficient equality visible, avoiding an assumed localization map.
Specializing to F[X][Y]->Frac(F[X][Y]) embeds the coordinate tower in
the actual generic field already proved to have degree 2^k. This
proves the coordinate domain property for every disjoint root-list
system with nonzero coefficients and at least one selected root per
equation. No coefficient height or smoothness is used in this step.

Finally the image algebra of the sum-of-radicals map is defined as
R[sum_i sqrt(f_i)] and identified with the literal range of polynomial
evaluation at that sum. Since the entire coordinate tower is a finite
R-module, it is a finite module over this actual image algebra. The
radical sum is also proved integral over R. This establishes the
algebraic finiteness of the affine projection; its birationality is
NOT yet proved. The generic primitive-element argument, Krull and
projective dimensions and degrees, curve exclusions, surface covering
and all two-variable point estimates remain open.

These are exact internal algebraic parts of the source proof, with
no new improvement identifier. T1.7 stays in_progress, coverage stays
79/167 and improvements stay 104. No surface-counting estimate is
treated as proved, no new external input or dependency download is
introduced, and the original sources and Palomar status are unchanged.

## The actual primitive radical sum and the birational affine projection

The radical-sum projection in Step 1 of companion T1.7 is now
proved birational in its literal algebraic sense. The inclusion of the
actual image algebra R[sum_i sqrt(f_i)] into the actual coordinate
tower induces a ring isomorphism of their fraction fields. The
isomorphism is proved to send every image-algebra element to that
same element in the source fraction field. Combined with the
previous finite-module theorem, this verifies the finiteness and
birationality of the actual affine projection.

First, each radical generator is identified with a distinct vector
of the explicit binary tower basis, proving their linear independence
over any commutative base ring. Every actual choice of radical signs
defines an algebra endomorphism by the already checked universal
property. Its square is the identity, so an actual sign automorphism
is constructed. In characteristic zero the sums for the 2^k sign
choices are pairwise distinct. Every such sum is a root of the
original sum's mapped minimal polynomial. The root count forces
degree at least 2^k; the tower dimension bounds it from above. The
minimal polynomial therefore has degree exactly 2^k, and its power
basis proves K[sum_i sqrt(f_i)] is the entire generic tower. The
independence hypothesis is discharged internally for the actual
generic split-radical family.

The recursive base-change map is proved to preserve the literal
radical sum. A general fraction-field lemma then identifies the
generic field as a fraction field of both the coordinate algebra
and its actual projection image: the subfield generated by the
base ring's image contains its fraction field K, and contains the
generic primitive sum, hence the whole generic extension. This
uses the actual injected ring maps and proves the extension on
every original element. It does not merely identify abstract
fields of the same degree or assume birationality as an input.

For the source system these statements hold over every characteristic-
zero field F, including an algebraic closure, for pairwise disjoint
integer root lists, nonzero coefficients and at least one selected
root per equation. Together with the previously proved coordinate
domain, free rank and universal point property, this completes the
algebraic integrality and finite birational projection assertions of
Step 1. The projective degree bounds on the image, Krull and
projective geometry, curve exclusions, surface coverings and the
two-variable host counts remain open. In particular the degree
2^k of the generic minimal polynomial is not yet counted as a proof
of the source projective-degree assertion.

These are internal proofs of the source algebra, with no new
mathematical-improvement identifier. T1.7 stays in_progress, coverage
stays 79/167 and confirmed improvements stay 104. No unproved
counting estimate, dependency download, original-source modification
or Palomar registration is introduced.

## P1-MATH-0105 — A monic equation and a free power basis for the actual affine image

The actual affine image in companion T1.7 now has its literal
monic irreducible equation and an explicit free power basis over the
base polynomial ring. Write R=F[X,Y], A for the actual quadratic
tower and s for the sum of its k radical generators. The actual
minimal polynomial P in R[Z] is monic, has Z-degree exactly 2^k,
and generates the full kernel of evaluation Z->s. The quotient
R[Z]/(P) is identified with the actual image subalgebra R[s], with
the isomorphism proved on every polynomial. Thus this is a
presentation of the image, rather than a polynomial merely
vanishing on a collection of source points.

The general argument works over any domain R with a characteristic-
zero fraction field K for which the actual mapped radicands are
independent. Every nonzero annihilating polynomial over R has
Z-degree at least 2^k. The finite free coordinate tower bounds the
minimal polynomial degree from above. Its coefficient map to K is
the actual generic minimal polynomial. Monic division then reflects
divisibility from K[Z] to R[Z] and proves the complete kernel
identity. No integral-closedness hypothesis on R is needed.

Transporting the actual quotient's power basis gives
  R[s] free and finite over R, of rank 2^k,
  with actual basis 1,s,...,s^(2^k-1).
This strengthens the source's description of the affine image and
is recorded as P1-MATH-0105. The freeness concerns the image as an
algebra over the plane; the finite birational map from A to its
image is a different morphism. All coefficients remain arbitrary
nonzero constants, and no height or smoothness premise is used
for this algebraic assertion.

A concrete algebra equivalence transports the nested polynomial
to Mathlib's MvPolynomial (Fin 3) F. Its coordinate 0 is Z, 1 is Y
and 2 is X; the variable images and literal evaluation are checked.
The transported equation is irreducible and its actual totalDegree
is at least 2^k. Every actual solution of the original split
equations maps to its zero at (sum w_i,Y,X). The point statement
is obtained from the already proved unique source ring map, not
from an assumed point-count or geometric correspondence.

Finally the monic projection equation is proved to commute with
arbitrary base changes that retain the actual generic independence.
For every characteristic-zero field extension the actual scaled
split polynomials, root-list system and projection equation all
commute with the literal coefficient maps. The original image
equation therefore remains irreducible after every such extension,
including passage to an algebraic closure. This verifies the
coefficient compatibility needed for geometric irreducibility.

The uniform upper bound on the defining total degree, projective
closure and degree formulas, curve exclusions, surface coverings
and two-variable host estimates remain open. The totalDegree
lower bound proved here is not a completed projective intersection-
theoretic degree argument. T1.7 stays in_progress and numbered
coverage stays 79/167. Confirmed improvements total 105; no error
in a manuscript conclusion is asserted. No external counting
input, dependency download, source-byte change or Palomar
registration is introduced.

## A universal integer equation and the coefficient-uniform image-degree bound

The actual defining polynomial of the split-radical image now
has both degree bounds needed in Step 1 of companion T1.7:
  2^k <= totalDegree(H) <= C(k)*max(1,K),
where each equation's two root lists have total size at most K.
The natural constant C(k) is defined as the actual total degree of
one fixed integer-coefficient universal polynomial. It depends only
on k, independently of the coefficient values, their heights,
smoothness, the selected integer roots, and the base field. This
also makes the upper dependence on the root-list degree linear.
The lower bound and the exact image presentation are the ones
already verified in the preceding checkpoint.

The proof constructs a literal tower over Z[T_1,...,T_k] and takes
the actual minimal polynomial of the sum of its formal radicals.
It is monic and has degree in Z at most 2^k by the already proved
finite free tower. Mapping T_i to the actual radicands specializes
this SAME polynomial to the actual image equation whenever the
target generic radicands are independent. The earlier base-change
theorem requires only independence in the target, so no unproved
generic square-class assertion about these universal parameters
is needed. The parameter-list map and every coefficient homomorphism
are checked on the actual rings.

The universal equation is transported to a multivariable polynomial
over Z, with one variable for the radical sum and k for the
radicands. Its literal evaluation in MvPolynomial (Fin 3) F is
proved equal to the actual image equation. A general support-sum
argument bounds the total degree of polynomial substitution by
the original total degree times the maximum substituend degree.
Each actual split radicand has lifted total degree at most its
two root-list sizes, and the sum variable has degree one. This
gives the displayed bound with no coefficient-height dependence
and no elimination or geometric estimate supplied as an input.

This extends P1-MATH-0105 with the fixed universal equation and
the linear-in-K degree bound. Its earlier free-power-basis finding
and validation are preserved in the history. Confirmed improvement
count remains 105, numbered coverage remains 79/167 and T1.7 stays
in_progress. The remaining work includes identification of the
projective closure's intersection-theoretic degree, the weighted
embedding and curve-degree formulas, surface coverings, curve
exclusions, and the actual two-variable host counts. No completed
projective or counting claim is inferred just from a total-degree
inequality. No external input, dependency download, original-source
change or Palomar registration is introduced.

## The actual radical, Veronese-chart and projection point heights

The actual point-height assertion in Step 2 of companion T1.7
is now proved from the literal integer equations. If |X|,|Y|<=2N,
the selected offsets have absolute value at most N, each pair of
root lists has total size at most K, and |c_i|<=N^A, every actual
integer solution of
  w_i^2=c_i*product_(a in I_i)(X+a)*product_(b in J_i)(Y+b)
satisfies |w_i|<=3^K*N^D whenever A+K<=2D. Here the finite radical
bound allows real D; the common-coordinate theorem takes an integer
D for the monomial degrees. It retains signed coefficients, all
integer X,Y, zero factors and zero radicals.

For k equations a single positive constant
  C(k,K,D)=2^D+(k+1)*3^K
bounds the absolute values of every actual affine monomial X^aY^b
with a+b<=D, every w_i and their literal sum by C(k,K,D)*N^D.
These are precisely the affine coordinates underlying the weighted
Veronese chart at Z=1, together with the radical-sum projection.
The integers remain actual integer coordinates; no presumed geometric
height or abstract bounding-box hypothesis is substituted for them.

The finite proof first bounds the natural absolute value of each
integer split product and squares the actual radical equation.
Real power monotonicity converts the coefficient-height exponent
to the required D, and the triangle inequality controls the sum.
The monomial bound is proved separately on the actual integer powers.
An eventual version then handles offset bounds b*(log N)^r for
arbitrary fixed b,r: one threshold precedes every coefficient family,
root-list system, point and radical solution. In particular it covers
the logarithmic offsets in the source with the asserted uniformity.

This verifies the elementary height component of Step 2, while the
construction of the projective embedding and its degree and curve-degree
identities remain open. The curve exclusions, surface coverings and
two-variable host counts also remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress,
coverage stays 79/167 and confirmed improvements stay 105; no new
improvement identifier is assigned to this checked source height
calculation. No external estimate, dependency download, original
source edit or Palomar registration is introduced.

Ubuntu root free space: 14.38 GiB.


## The actual selected-value obstruction on rational lines

The functional-square obstruction on affine rational lines in
Step 3 of companion T1.7 is now proved for the actual finite sets of
selected positive values. It uses their literal even-selection maps
and square-class spaces, rather than requiring independence of the
larger full windows. Two equations with disjoint nonempty first root
lists already suffice. The second selected set's even-selection map
need not be injective; the two actual even image spaces must remain
in direct sum. Coefficients are arbitrary nonzero rational constants.

The polynomial proof is explicit. A square polynomial has zero
derivative at each root. If a product c*P*Q is square, c!=0 and P
is separable, every root of P must therefore be a root of Q.
Applying this to the literal restriction Y=alpha*X+beta of each
scaled split equation forces every first-list root to match an
actual second-list root. Squares in the actual rational-function
field are reflected to the integrally closed polynomial ring before
this argument is applied. No root-matching statement is assumed.

The selected-value arithmetic is proved on arbitrary finite positive
integer sets S,T. Two distinct elements of S and a proportional pair
in T give the same nonzero even square class in both actual spaces.
Injectivity of the first even map makes that class nonzero, and
directness gives the contradiction. The positive offset values are
identified with their actual natural absolute values and rational
casts. Two disjoint equations supply the required distinct pair.
This includes horizontal slopes alpha=0; swapping the coordinates
also proves the vertical-line functional-square obstruction.

The result is connected to the actual split-radical coordinate
algebra. The literal polynomial map substituting a rational line
is checked on each scaled split radicand. Any ring homomorphism
from the actual coordinate tower to Q(T) agreeing with that line
map on Q[X,Y] would turn every actual radical-square relation into
the forbidden functional squares. Its nonexistence is proved, so
the obstruction is not left as an unexplained square-condition input.

This extends the one-sided arithmetic refinement P1-MATH-0019 to
selected sets and the line step of T1.7. Its earlier complete T20.5
validation is preserved in the finding history. No independence
weakening is claimed for the entire two-variable host-count lemma.
The geometric step identifying a curve of minimal projective degree
with a degree-one function-field map to a line remains open, as do
the weighted projective degree formulas, surface coverings and final
two-variable counts. T1.7 stays in_progress, coverage stays 79/167
and confirmed improvements stay 105. No external estimate, dependency
download, source-byte modification or Palomar registration is introduced.

## The literal homogenized split-radical coordinate domain

The underlying coordinate algebra of the actual homogenized
split-radical presentation in Step 2 of companion T1.7 is now proved
to be a domain. Over every characteristic-zero field F, take the
literal polynomial ring F[Z][X][Y] and actual radicands
  c_i*Z^(e_i)*product_(a in I_i)(X+a*Z)*product_(b in J_i)(Y+b*Z).
The coefficients c_i are arbitrary nonzero elements, the integer
root lists are pairwise disjoint in each coordinate, and at least
one list in each equation is nonempty. The literal quadratic tower
is finite free of rank 2^k over this three-variable base. Its domain
property is proved internally for arbitrary natural e_i, and hence
includes the source exponents e_i=2D-|I_i|-|J_i|. No point-height
or coefficient-smoothness premise enters this algebraic assertion.

The proof first extends the nonsquare split-word lemmas from integer
roots to arbitrary finite sets of distinct field roots. These
supporting nonsquare and finite-product independence statements hold
over any field; the subsequent actual quadratic-field construction
uses characteristic zero as before. Nonempty disjoint selections
have nonsquare product, and their actual generic tower is proved
to be a field of degree 2^k. No Kummer or field-degree assertion
is assumed as an input.

For the homogenized system, an explicit injective coefficient map
F[Z]->F(Z) is lifted through both polynomial coordinates. If z is
the actual nonzero fraction-field image of Z, the source root lists
become the literal finite sets {a*z:a in I_i} and {b*z:b in J_i}.
Their disjointness is proved using the injectivity of a->a*z in
characteristic zero. The mapped coefficient is c_i*z^(e_i), proved
nonzero. Every actual radicand and the complete equation list are
proved to map to these exact scaled root words. Passing to the
fraction field F(Z)(X,Y) gives the internally constructed generic
field. The recursive tower base-change map is faithful, proving
that the original homogenized coordinate algebra is a domain.

This provides the literal integral algebra underlying the source
weighted presentation, including over an algebraically closed base.
The formal grading, the explicit Z=1 specialization, generation of
the D-th Veronese algebra, the projective embedding and cover-degree
and curve-degree identities remain open. The surface coverings and
two-variable host counts also remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress,
numbered coverage stays 79/167 and confirmed improvements stay 105.
These are checked source-algebra foundations with no new improvement
identifier. No external input, dependency download, original-source
change or Palomar registration is introduced.

## The literal weighted presentation, homogeneous relations and Z=1 chart

The literal weighted polynomial quotient in Step 2 of T1.7 is
now identified with the already constructed homogenized radical
coordinate algebra. This is an explicit ring equivalence, rather
than an identification of informal presentations. The actual
quotient by W_i^2-c_i*Z^(2D-|I_i|-|J_i|)*product(X+aZ)*product(Y+bZ)
is consequently proved to be a domain over every characteristic-zero
field, under the source nonzero-coefficient, nonempty and disjoint
root-list hypotheses. No integrality premise is left in this source
corollary.

A general presentation theorem first constructs inverse algebra maps
between R[W_1,...,W_k]/(W_i^2-a_i) and the literal quadratic tower,
for every commutative ring R and every radicand list, including the
empty list. The maps preserve every radical generator. The kernel
of the actual polynomial evaluation is proved to be exactly the
relation ideal. The weighted presentation is transported to this
general quotient through the actual variable-sum equivalence and
the checked three-variable polynomial equivalence. Every generator
and every actual source relation is tracked through those maps.

In the native three-variable polynomial ring, the homogenized
radicands are proved homogeneous of degree 2D whenever their root
count is at most 2D. Nonzero coefficients give nonzero radicands and
exact total degree 2D; these polynomial statements hold over every
field, without a characteristic-zero assumption. The actual weighted
relations, with base-variable weights 1 and radical-variable weight
D, are proved weighted homogeneous of degree 2D. Their literal span
ideal is homogeneous for the native weighted polynomial grading.

The Z=1 coefficient evaluation, lifted through both polynomial
coordinates, sends each actual homogenized radicand and the entire
list to the previously checked affine system. The recursive base
change supplies an actual ring homomorphism between the corresponding
coordinate algebras, commuting with this base evaluation.

The induced quotient grading as a bundled graded algebra, generation
of its D-th Veronese algebra, the projective construction and its
cover- and curve-degree formulas remain open. This checkpoint does
not infer projective degree formulas from the affine polynomial
identities. The external surface covering and the two-variable host
counts also remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress, numbered coverage
stays 79/167, and confirmed improvements stay 105. These are checked
source-algebra foundations with no new improvement identifier. No
external estimate, new dependency, original manuscript change or
Palomar registration is introduced.

## The actual quotient grading and precise Veronese generators

The literal weighted quotient in T1.7 Step 2 now carries a
constructed GradedAlgebra structure. Weighted homogeneous polynomial
components descend through the actual homogeneous relation ideal as
linear projections on the quotient. On each actual image piece,
projection to its own degree is the identity and projection to every
other degree is zero. These projections prove injectivity of the
canonical direct-sum recomposition; polynomial decomposition proves
surjectivity. Multiplication and the unit respect the actual pieces.
This is a proved quotient grading, not a grading asserted from the
notation. The general construction works over every commutative
coefficient ring and every homogeneous weighted polynomial ideal.

For the source quotient, the actual base variables have degree 1 and
the actual radical variables have degree D, with their literal
projection formulas checked. For positive D its degree-zero piece
is exactly the scalar image. The root-count bound at most 2D supplies
the previously proved homogeneity of the source relation ideal.

The D-th Veronese algebra is defined as the actual range of the
canonical algebra map from the direct sum of pieces of degrees nD.
Its underlying module is proved to be the supremum of these actual
pieces. It equals the subalgebra generated by those pieces, and is
now proved generated by the single piece of degree D. The argument
splits actual finitely supported exponent vectors of weights 1 or
D into successive vectors of weight D, proves the monomial image
statement and then sums homogeneous polynomials. It applies through
every algebra map, including the actual quotient map; no Veronese
generation assertion is supplied as an input.

The precise source generator set is also proved: the base monomials
of ordinary degree D with every radical exponent zero, together
with the individual radical variables. Every weight-D monomial with
a radical factor is proved to be that single radical times a scalar;
all remaining monomials are the stated pure base monomials. Their
images generate the actual source Veronese algebra. For finitely many
radicals the generator set is finite and the Veronese algebra is
proved of finite type. Under the actual characteristic-zero source
root-list hypotheses, its domain property is discharged internally
using the previous literal quotient-domain theorem.

This completes the source-algebra grading and Veronese-generation
steps. The projective construction, finiteness over the projective
plane, its cover degree and the surface- and curve-degree identities
remain open. No projective degree formula is inferred solely from
this algebraic generation result. The external surface covering and
the two-variable host counts remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress,
numbered coverage stays 79/167 and confirmed improvements stay 105.

## The finite inclusion over the pure base Veronese image

The actual inclusion of the pure base Veronese image into the
source Veronese algebra is now proved to be a finite ring map.
The base image is the subalgebra of the literal weighted quotient
generated by the images of the degree-D monomials in the three base
variables. The target is the actual Veronese algebra constructed as
the range of the direct sum of its multiple-degree pieces. The map
is the literal inclusion of these subalgebras.

Native homogeneous polynomials of every degree nD in the three base
variables are proved to map into that pure base algebra, using the
already checked exponent splitting and the explicit coefficient and
monomial maps. In particular every actual source homogenized
radicand, of degree 2D, belongs to the base image. This membership is
proved for the exact c_i*Z^(2D-|I_i|-|J_i|) split products, rather
than supplied as an abstract integrality premise.

Each actual quotient radical is packaged as an element of the target
Veronese algebra. Its square is proved equal to the actual radicand
image using membership of the literal defining relation in the
literal relation ideal. The target is proved to be generated by the
base image and these radicals. A general checked finite-inclusion
lemma constructs the canonical relative algebra, proves every such
radical integral by its monic quadratic relation, verifies that its
adjoin is the entire target and proves module finiteness. Applying
that lemma discharges every premise with the actual source objects.

This finite-map statement holds over every field, for finitely many
equations, positive D and root counts at most 2D. It needs no
nonzero-coefficient, characteristic-zero or disjointness hypothesis;
those separate hypotheses already prove integrality of the source
Veronese algebra. Finiteness here concerns the affine Veronese cone
inclusion. The identification of the pure base image with the
standard plane Veronese algebra, the relative free rank and cover
degree 2^k, the projective finite morphism and all projective degree
formulas remain open. The external surface covering and two-variable
host counts remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress, numbered coverage
stays 79/167 and confirmed improvements stay 105. No new improvement

change or Palomar registration is introduced.

## The faithful finite map from the standard base Veronese algebra

The pure base algebra in T1.7 Step 2 is now identified by an
explicit F-algebra equivalence with the standard D-th Veronese
algebra of the native polynomial ring F[X,Y,Z]. This standard algebra
is defined as the actual range of the direct sum of the ordinary
homogeneous pieces of degrees nD, not as a polynomial ring assumed
to represent the base.

The coded pure base monomials in the full weighted variable set are
proved to be exactly the images, under the literal base-variable
rename, of ordinary degree-D monomials in three variables. The reverse
identification constructs the actual exponent preimage and proves
that its image is the original exponent vector using the vanishing
of all radical exponents. Native homogeneous degree-D polynomials
and the standard Veronese algebra have these exact generators.
Mapping them through the actual quotient gives precisely the pure
base image used in the finite-inclusion checkpoint.

The complete native three-variable polynomial map into the literal
weighted quotient is proved injective. Under the explicit weighted
presentation equivalence, its value on every polynomial is the
canonical base image of that polynomial under the checked
three-variable equivalence into the actual radical tower. The base
map into this tower is injective even for arbitrary radicands. Thus
the base injectivity uses no domain assertion and no square-class
independence premise. Restriction to the standard Veronese algebra
gives the stated explicit base equivalence and its value formula.

Composing this equivalence with the already verified pure-base
inclusion constructs the actual standard-base-to-source-Veronese
ring map. Its injectivity and finiteness are proved. These results
hold over every field for the exact indexed source system; positive
D and the source root-count bound supply the finite-map assertion.
No nonzero-coefficient, characteristic-zero or disjointness premise
is needed for this finite faithful base map. The separate source
integrality theorem retains its own exact hypotheses.

The relative free rank and generic cover degree 2^k, the projective
finite morphism, the identification of the base projective scheme
with the projective plane, and all projective degree formulas remain
open. This checkpoint identifies and proves the actual affine-cone
base map; it does not infer those projective conclusions from ring
finiteness alone. The external surface covering and two-variable
host counts remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress, numbered coverage
stays 79/167 and confirmed improvements stay 105. No new improvement
identifier, external estimate, dependency download, original-source
change or Palomar registration is introduced.

## P1-MATH-0106 — An actual relative free basis of the source Veronese algebra

The actual source D-th Veronese algebra is now proved finite
free of rank 2^k over the standard three-variable D-th Veronese
base. A literal basis is constructed and its value in the weighted
quotient is checked on every basis index. This strengthens the
finite-base-map result and is recorded as P1-MATH-0106. It concerns
the source Veronese algebra; P1-MATH-0105 concerns the different
radical-sum affine image algebra.

Each actual homogenized radicand has ordinary degree 2D and is
constructed as an element of the standard Veronese base. The literal
quadratic tower over that base is free of rank 2^k by its recursive
normal basis. Its coefficient inclusion into the full three-variable
polynomial ring is proved injective, and each actual radicand and
the complete equation list are proved to map to their exact original
homogenized polynomials. The faithful tower base change is followed
by literal list transport and the explicit weighted presentation
equivalence, giving an actual injective map into the source quotient.

Every radical generator, every normal basis vector and the base
inclusion are proved to commute with the actual base change. The
relative map sends its generators to the exact source quotient
radicals, with all list indices tracked. Its image as a base algebra,
after restricting scalars, is proved to be exactly the source
Veronese algebra: the scalar range is the previously identified pure
base image and the generator range is the actual radical range.
The exact source generation theorem supplies both inclusions.

The image basis is transported through this proved image equality
to the actual source Veronese algebra. Its module structure is the
one induced by the previously constructed standard-base ring map,
and the scalar compatibility is checked explicitly. The resulting
basis, freeness, module finiteness and exact rank 2^k are internal
Lean conclusions. No freeness, image equality, degree or counting
assertion is supplied as an assumption.

The finite-free statement holds over every field and for arbitrary
coefficients, including zero coefficients, whenever D is positive
and every root count is at most 2D. It does not require characteristic
zero, disjointness, nonempty root sets or generic square-class
independence. Those hypotheses remain separate inputs to the already
proved integrality statement. The general basis and faithful-map
lemmas work for arbitrary commutative coefficient rings, with
nontriviality where needed for finrank.

This supplies the exact relative algebraic free rank underlying
Step 2. The projective construction, the base projective-scheme
identification, the degree-zero function-field bridge, the projective
cover degree and all surface- and curve-degree formulas remain open.
No projective conclusion is inferred solely from this affine-cone
module computation. External surface coverings and two-variable
host counts remain open. T1.7 stays in_progress and numbered coverage
stays 79/167. Confirmed improvements total 106; no manuscript
conclusion error is asserted. No external estimate, dependency
download, original-source change or Palomar registration is introduced.

## P1-MATH-0106 extended — The actual rescaled grading, homogeneous basis and graded base map

Both actual Veronese algebras now carry the grading in which
original degree nD becomes degree n. The construction is made on
their literal direct-sum range algebras, with degree-n piece equal
to the preimage of the original degree-nD piece. Original homogeneous
projections lift to actual linear projections on the Veronese
algebra. For positive D their action on each image piece is the
identity in its own degree and zero in every other degree.
Injectivity and surjectivity of recomposition are proved, followed
by the actual GradedAlgebra structure and its projection formula.

For the standard three-variable base and the literal source weighted
quotient, generation in degree D is transported to generation of
these actual rescaled rings by their degree-one pieces. Every exact
source generator, including each radical, is proved to belong to
degree one. The source degree-zero piece is exactly its scalar image.
The source quotient grading uses the source root-count bound; the
rescaling uses positive D. No generation or decomposition assertion
is assumed as an unproved interface.

The free normal basis of P1-MATH-0106 is now proved homogeneous. A
recursive index weight counts the selected radicals and is proved
at most k. For any actual ring map from a quadratic tower to a
graded ring, homogeneous radical images of degree D imply that the
image of each literal normal basis vector has degree D times its
index weight. Applying this statement to the exact relative map,
using its checked generator formulas, proves that the actual source
basis vector belongs to rescaled degree equal to that weight, with
all weights between 0 and k. This is a statement about the already
constructed source basis, not a new basis assumed homogeneous.

Finally the actual finite faithful standard-base map is proved to
preserve every rescaled degree and is bundled as a GradedRingHom.
The proof transports every ordinary homogeneous native base
polynomial through the literal variable rename into the weighted
polynomial grading, and then through the actual quotient map. The
bundled graded map retains the previously verified injectivity and
finiteness properties. These results extend P1-MATH-0106 without a
new improvement identifier.

The Hilbert-function computation, projective construction and its
degree-zero function-field bridge, finite projective cover degree
and all surface- and curve-degree identities remain open. The
external surface covering and two-variable host counts remain open.

improvements stay 106. No external estimate, dependency download,
original-source change or Palomar registration is introduced.
