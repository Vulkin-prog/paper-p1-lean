# Multiquadratic split radicands: exact square-class independence

The square-class independence assertion at the beginning of Step 1
of companion T1.7 is now proved literally. Let F be ANY field of
characteristic zero, and use the fraction field of F[X][Y]. For a
family of integer root lists I_i,J_i, pairwise disjoint within each
coordinate list, and arbitrary nonzero constants c_i in F, the actual
square classes of
  c_i * product_(a in I_i)(X+a) * product_(b in J_i)(Y+b)
are linearly independent over F_2 whenever I_i or J_i is nonempty
for each i. The index type can be arbitrary; linear independence is
checked on every finite subfamily. In particular this applies over
an algebraically closed characteristic-zero base, not just over Q.

The proof uses the existing internal reflection of squares from a
fraction field to its integrally closed polynomial ring. Passing to
one coordinate fraction field makes the scalar and the other split
factor units; the remaining nonempty split factor is separable and
not a unit, so its product with this nonzero scalar is not a square.
Swapping coordinates covers an empty root list on either side.
Exact product identities identify a finite subfamily product with
the nonzero product scalar times the split word on the two literal
unions of its disjoint root lists. Every nonempty subfamily product
is therefore nonsquare. The existing actual field square-class
quotient and a proved binary coefficient argument turn this into
literal F_2 linear independence. Nonzero radicands are proved too.

There is no smoothness or coefficient-height hypothesis in this
algebraic assertion. These hypotheses were already unnecessary for
the source independence argument, so no new mathematical-improvement
identifier is assigned. This adds the checked algebraic independence
part of Step 1, rather than a multiquadratic surface point count.
The general coordinate-ring freeness, field/localization and finite
birational projection arguments, the surface covering, curve-degree
exclusions and the two-variable estimates remain open. T1.7 stays
in_progress, coverage stays 79/167 and confirmed improvements stay
104. No external determinant estimate is treated as proved, and no
dependency download, original source change or Palomar registration
is introduced.
