# Actual normalized-defect pair activity at source scale

Every actual pair joint mass is now bounded by
p_nominal^2*2^(full pair loss), without regularity or affine compatibility.
The proof uses the complete actual tuple rank, including its zero-mass
branch, and the exact identity rank+full_loss=2L. Every fixed rational
channel a:b, a<b, now has individual actual joint and absolute centered
weights at most N^(-2+1/b+epsilon) on all exact-unit source pairs. The
uniform aligned residual rank theorem supplies the missing nonprivate
rank factor. Heterogeneous marginal caps retain irregular and zero sites.

For the literal badSources family whose normalized union is not private
above H, the already proved N^(1/2+epsilon) count therefore gives both
unordered joint mass and absolute centered activity at most

    N^(-3/2+1/b+epsilon),

uniformly for critical lengths and 2b(L+1)<=H<=D(L+1), with a,b,D fixed
before N. This is the normalized-defect contribution used in T7.1; for
b>=3 it is smaller than N^(-1+epsilon). No disjointness of normalization
representations is assumed: image sums are bounded by positive source
sums, retaining every probability-zero pair. The proof is unconditional.

T7.1 and main 3.3 stay in progress: the regular macroscopic nonaligned
sector, full rational-channel classification and complete signed pair
profile remain open. Coverage stays 77/167 (main 28/73, companion 49/94),
confirmed improvements 94. This checkpoint proves an existing source-scale
contribution and introduces no new mathematical correction, external
premise, axiom, dependency download, original-source change or Palomar
registration.
