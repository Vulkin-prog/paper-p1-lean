# Actual normalized-defect pair activity at source scale

Every actual pair joint mass is now bounded by
p_nominal^2*2^(full pair loss), without regularity or affine compatibility.
The proof uses the complete actual tuple rank, including its zero-mass
branch, and the exact identity rank+full_loss=2L. Every fixed rational
channel a:b, a<b, now has individual actual joint and absolute centered
weights at most N^(-2+1/b+epsilon) on all exact-unit source pairs. The
uniform aligned residual rank theorem supplies the missing nonprivate
rank factor. Heterogeneous marginal caps retain irregular and zero sites.

For the literal badSources family whose normalized union is not private
above H, the already proved N^(1/2+epsilon) count therefore gives both
unordered joint mass and absolute centered activity at most

    N^(-3/2+1/b+epsilon),

uniformly for critical lengths and 2b(L+1)<=H<=D(L+1), with a,b,D fixed
before N. This is the normalized-defect contribution used in T7.1; for
b>=3 it is smaller than N^(-1+epsilon). No disjointness of normalization
representations is assumed: image sums are bounded by positive source
sums, retaining every probability-zero pair. The proof is unconditional.

T7.1 and main 3.3 stay in progress: the regular macroscopic nonaligned
sector, full rational-channel classification and complete signed pair
profile remain open. Coverage stays 77/167 (main 28/73, companion 49/94),
confirmed improvements 94. This checkpoint proves an existing source-scale
contribution and introduces no new mathematical correction, external
premise, axiom, dependency download, original-source change or Palomar
registration.

## The complete exact-unit channel tail up to height (L+1)^3

The channel weight bounds are now uniform simultaneously over all
reduced a:b with 0<a<b, b0<=b<=(L+1)^3, where only b0,C,epsilon are fixed
before the threshold. Actual joint and absolute centered weights of every
exact-unit pair are at most N^(-2+1/b0+epsilon), without BCN, private
normalizations or regular-site assumptions. The proof uses the genuinely
uniform aligned rank theorem; it does not take a growing maximum of
fixed-channel thresholds.

The literal unordered union over all these channels is constructed. A
finite weighted cover has cost at most 4(L+1)^8*N times a common pointwise
weight cap. It counts at most 4(L+1)^6 coefficient pairs and uses the
actual N(L+1)^2 source cover in each channel. Duplicate edge or source
representations require no disjointness assumption. The whole logarithmic
factor is absorbed only after these finite counts.
Consequently both joint mass and absolute centered activity of the full
exact-unit channel union are at most

    N^(-1+1/b0+epsilon).

For b0=3 this gives N^(-2/3+epsilon) over every channel of height up to
(L+1)^3. For b0=5 it proves the source residual N^(-4/5+epsilon) for the
entire exact-unit high-channel tail, including nonprivate and irregular
sources. The parameter varying with N here is the channel height, not the
number of windows or moment order.

This proves another source-scale part of main 3.3 and T7.1. It does not
identify all aligned pairs with exact-unit pairs, treat zero-unit enlarged
alignments, prove the macroscopic nonaligned sector, or complete the signed
pair profile. Main 3.3 and T7.1 stay in progress. Coverage stays 77/167
(main 28/73, companion 49/94), confirmed improvements 94. No new correction,
external premise, axiom, dependency download, original-source change or
Palomar registration is introduced.

## Complete aligned principal profile

The entire original enlarged aligned unordered pair family is now
constructed using CompressedTargetAlignment.Aligned 1, with logarithmic
height at most (L+1)^3. Uniform dyadic geometry orients every representing
reduced channel as a <= b <= 2a. Its positive activity is covered by the
height-one and height-two boundary classes, private good 2:3 and 3:4
pairs, their normalized defects, zero-unit alignments, and the full
height-at-least-five tail. No disjointness of that cover is presumed.
Private one-unit pairs have zero actual centered coefficient, including
their affine prescription. All original irregular sites and zero exact
marginals are included.

Let beta be the actual joint mass of the compatible private principal
2:3 and 3:4 edges. For every fixed C, epsilon>0 and natural D, eventually
uniformly in the critical window and 8(L+1) <= H <= D(L+1), both the
absolute activity and the signed centered sum of ALL aligned pairs
differ from beta by at most N^(-4/5+epsilon). This is unconditional: no
BCN assumption is used. Separately, every pair subfamily F of the dyadic
block satisfies 0 <= A_F - C_F <= N^(-1+epsilon), uniformly over F.

An exact original-model identity splits alpha-2 beta into twice the
signed nonaligned sum, twice the aligned error, and the negative
single-site square diagonal. Consequently

    |alpha - 2 beta| <= 2 A_dense + N^(-4/5+epsilon).

Here dense is a literal finite residual family, not a presumed bound:
it consists only of regular, compatible nonaligned unordered pairs with
actual relative nullity greater than L/10. The weak, incompatible,
irregular and zero-coefficient classes have been removed using checked
estimates and an exact finite cover. The nonaligned complement retains
the full dyadic population before those removals.

The same bound holds with 2 beta replaced by the explicit sum
ChannelMainTermBounds.mainTerm N L 2 3 + mainTerm N L 3 4, using both
checked fixed-channel mass errors. These main terms retain the exact
signed finite channel sums, their source translation coefficients and
the nominal single-site scale; no phase limit is assumed.

This completes the aligned part of the actual second-cumulant profile.
It DOES NOT bound A_dense, prove the hard dense nonaligned weighted
estimate T1.8, or complete the unweighted positive/signed profile,
main 3.3 or T7.1. Both numbered results stay in progress and T1.8 stays
not started. Coverage stays 77/167 (main 28/73, companion 49/94), with
94 confirmed improvements. No new correction, external premise, axiom,
dependency download, original manuscript edit or Palomar registration
is introduced.
