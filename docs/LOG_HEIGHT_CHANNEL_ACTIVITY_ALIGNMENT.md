# Uniform actual channel activity up to logarithmic height

The channel weight bounds are now uniform simultaneously over all
reduced a:b with 0<a<b, b0<=b<=(L+1)^3, where only b0,C,epsilon are fixed
before the threshold. Actual joint and absolute centered weights of every
exact-unit pair are at most N^(-2+1/b0+epsilon), without BCN, private
normalizations or regular-site assumptions. The proof uses the genuinely
uniform aligned rank theorem; it does not take a growing maximum of
fixed-channel thresholds.

The literal unordered union over all these channels is constructed. A
finite weighted cover has cost at most 4(L+1)^8*N times a common pointwise
weight cap. It counts at most 4(L+1)^6 coefficient pairs and uses the
actual N(L+1)^2 source cover in each channel. Duplicate edge or source
representations require no disjointness assumption. The whole logarithmic
factor is absorbed only after these finite counts.
Consequently both joint mass and absolute centered activity of the full
exact-unit channel union are at most

    N^(-1+1/b0+epsilon).

For b0=3 this gives N^(-2/3+epsilon) over every channel of height up to
(L+1)^3. For b0=5 it proves the source residual N^(-4/5+epsilon) for the
entire exact-unit high-channel tail, including nonprivate and irregular
sources. The parameter varying with N here is the channel height, not the
number of windows or moment order.

This proves another source-scale part of main 3.3 and T7.1. It does not
identify all aligned pairs with exact-unit pairs, treat zero-unit enlarged
alignments, prove the macroscopic nonaligned sector, or complete the signed
pair profile. Main 3.3 and T7.1 stay in progress. Coverage stays 77/167
(main 28/73, companion 49/94), confirmed improvements 94. No new correction,
external premise, axiom, dependency download, original-source change or
Palomar registration is introduced.

## Full enlarged aligned tail with zero exact units

Zero-exact-unit enlarged alignments are now handled on the original
model. The actual relative pair nullity is bounded by the full pair loss.
The complete uniform enlarged aligned rank theorem bounds that loss by
eta(L+1) when the normalized unit set is empty, including both coefficient
orientations. After the fixed margin is chosen, each actually dependent
such pair belongs to the already checked weak class. Direct pairs have
zero centered coefficient, even with zero marginals. Their total absolute
activity is therefore at most N^(-1+epsilon), without BCN.

A literal family of enlarged aligned unordered dyadic pairs is constructed
for all reduced 0<a<b with b0<=b<=(L+1)^3. Every member either has an
exact unit and belongs to the previously checked channel union, or is a
zero-unit enlarged alignment. A finite positive cover, with overlap costs
kept nonnegative, gives for the full family

    A_aligned(b0) <= N^(-1+1/b0+epsilon).

In particular all these channels from height 3 have activity at most
N^(-2/3+epsilon), and their full tail from height 5 has activity at most
N^(-4/5+epsilon), now including alignments with no exact unit. The number
of windows remains two; the logarithmic-height quantifiers are uniform.

This closes the full enlarged aligned high-channel tail needed by main
3.3 and T7.1. It does not classify the height-one/two boundary population,
complete the principal-channel comparison with all aligned pairs, or bound
the remaining macroscopic nonaligned sector. The complete signed pair
profile and T7.1 remain in progress. Coverage stays 77/167 (main 28/73,
companion 49/94), confirmed improvements 94. No new correction, external
premise, axiom, dependency download, original-source change or Palomar
registration is introduced.
