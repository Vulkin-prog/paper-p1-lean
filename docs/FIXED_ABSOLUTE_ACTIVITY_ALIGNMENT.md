# Actual absolute centered activity at every fixed order

Source: companion T14.1. Status: **in progress** for its sharper connected exponent and contact assertion.

The actual absolute centered activity now has a uniform half-power bound
at every fixed positive order under the existing explicit BCN premise.
For every fixed r>=1 and eta>0, every critical L and every G contained in
the dyadic block, eventually

    sum_(I subset G, |I|=r) |c(I)| <= N^(-1/2+eta).

The connected subfamily satisfies the same bound. These are absolute sums
of the actual centered Bochner coefficients, not absolute values of signed
sums or a consequence of scalar factorial-moment cancellation. Zero
marginals and incompatible affine families are included. The order and
all finite lower-order assemblies are fixed before N.

The finite decomposition is unconditional. Nonempty direct families have
zero actual centered coefficient, including their zero-marginal cases.
Expanding the absolute heterogeneous centering transform and separating its
direct and dependent subfamilies gives, with mu=sum_x p_x,

    A_r <= 2^r * productDependentMass_r
           + sum_(s=0..r) jointDependentMass_s * mu^(r-s)/(r-s)!.

Both masses use actual geometric dependence rho>0. In the second mass,
q(A) is the actual joint probability, and the complementary marginals
are their actual heterogeneous products. Exact disjoint-subset incidence
and the previously proved cardinality convolution give this finite bound.
No absolute-activity estimate is a premise.

A new unconditional estimate proves, for every fixed r and eta>0,

    productDependentMass_r <= N^(-1+eta).

Every dependent family contains a primitive seed. A finite seed-cover
inequality preserves its entire nonnegative heterogeneous product weight:
for s-site seeds and total size s+k, completion costs at most
mu^k/k! times the actual seed product mass. Primitive host counts,
the actual local marginal cap, and the actual mean bound give the displayed
product estimate; no BCN or actual joint estimate is used here.

For the full absolute activity, the actual dependent joint masses at the
finitely many orders 0..r are at most N^(-1/2+eta) under BCN. The actual
mean is uniformly bounded, so the finite decomposition yields the claimed
half-power bound after absorbing fixed constants. BCN is the already
inventoried ordinary explicit plane-curve argument.

Companion T14.1 moves from not_started to in_progress. Its sharper connected
4/5 exponent and its separate N^(-1+eta) absolute contact bound are not
claimed. The proof makes no growing-order use of fixed-order estimates.
No numbered result or new mathematical finding is counted complete.
Coverage stays 77/167 (main 28/73, companion 49/94), improvements stay 89.
Original manuscript bytes, compiler/dependency pins and the later Palomar
milestone are preserved; no dependency download or axiom is introduced.

Ubuntu root free space: 15.41 GiB. The finite absolute-activity decomposition and fixed-order dependent product mass N^(-1+eta) are unconditional. Full and connected actual absolute centered activity at every fixed positive order are at most N^(-1/2+eta) under the existing ordinary explicit BCN premise, uniformly over all dyadic subgrounds. Zero marginals and incompatible families are included; no fixed-order theorem is used at growing order. Companion T14.1 stays in progress for its sharper connected 4/5 exponent and contact bound. Coverage 77/167; improvements 89.


## Actual weak pairs, incompatible pairs and marked irregular rows

Two source-scale parts of companion T7.1 are now proved unconditionally
on the actual original model. Weak dependent pairs are defined literally by
rho(e)<=eta*L or q(e)=0. Their absolute activity is at most
N^(-1+eta+epsilon), for every fixed eta>=0 and epsilon>0. The finite
coefficient bound is 2*2^(eta*L)*prod_(x in e)p_x; the already checked
N^(-1+epsilon) product mass of dependent families supplies the total bound.
No common marginal, positive source mass or BCN premise is required.

Every covariance edge touching an irregular start has total absolute
activity at most N^(-1+epsilon). A finite marked-star cover bounds its mass
by the row sum over the marked sites. The unconditional actual row bound
and actual irregular marginal mass prove the estimate, including zero
marginals. An explicit disjoint three-part partition of the actual dependent
pairs separates the irregular class, the weak class after its removal, and
the remaining class. Their activity sums exactly to A2. Every remaining
pair is compatible, avoids irregular sites and has rho(e)>eta*L.
The remaining rational-channel/dense nonaligned analysis is not asserted.
T7.1 therefore moves from not_started to in_progress, not to proved.

All actual incompatible pair activity is also bounded unconditionally by
the dependent product mass, hence by N^(-1+epsilon). The exact pair sign
identity is A2-C2=2*A2_incompatible, with C2 the signed pair sum. The exact
heterogeneous second-cumulant formula consequently yields

    A2(G)-alpha(G)/2 = 2*A2_incompatible(G)+sum_(x in G)p_x^2/2.

The right side is nonnegative and eventually at most N^(-1+epsilon),
uniformly for all critical lengths and dyadic subgrounds. For the full
original dyadic count, the independently proved positive 2:3 channel lower
bound alpha>=d*L*N^(-2/3) gives the stronger quantitative equivalence

    alpha>0,
    0 <= 2*A2/alpha-1 <= N^(-1/3+epsilon).

These statements keep the actual moving mean, second cumulant, irregular
windows and all zero-marginal cases. They do not assume a full pair profile,
a sharp upper bound on A2 or the external BCN estimate. This new corollary
is recorded as improvement P1-MATH-0090 for later manuscript integration.
It does not prove the remaining full profile, the source A2 upper bound,
the good-channel partition or sharp triple/quartic errors. Main 3.3 remains
in progress. Coverage stays 77/167 (main 28/73, companion 49/94); confirmed
improvements increase to 90. No new external input, axiom, dependency
download, source-byte change or Palomar registration is introduced.

Ubuntu root free space: 15.30 GiB. Weak dependent activity N^(-1+eta+epsilon), irregular-touching and incompatible pair activity N^(-1+epsilon), the exact initial disjoint partition, and the quantitative full-count equivalence 0<=2*A2/alpha-1<=N^(-1/3+epsilon) are unconditional. No BCN, complete signed profile or target A2 estimate is supplied as a premise. T7.1 and main 3.3 remain in progress; coverage 77/167, confirmed improvements 90.


## Nonconnected activity at every fixed order

Actual canonical components are now handled as original finite subsets
at every finite order. Their union recovers I, every part is nonempty and
connected, and the original coefficient satisfies c(I)=prod_(C in P(I))c(C).
The absolute identity also holds exactly. Reindexing the subtype parts is
injective, so no duplicate part or hidden multiplicity is introduced.
If c(I)!=0, every part has at least two sites. Every nonempty nonconnected
family has at least two canonical parts. These finite statements include
zero marginals and incompatible families; only L>0 is needed for the
probability factorization.

A separate arbitrary-weight finite polymer lemma proves the tail bound

    sum_(P subset A, |P|>=2) prod_(C in P)w(C)
        <= (W^2/2)*exp(W),  W=sum_(C in A)w(C), w>=0.

An actual decomposition whose union recovers its source family is injective
as a finite record, so the same bound controls any covered family with
at least two blocks. No independence of arbitrary polymers is assumed.
Applying this to the actual canonical components gives, for every fixed r>=1,

    A_r - A_r_connected = A_r_nonconnected >= 0,
    A_r_nonconnected <= (W_r^2/2)*exp(W_r),

where W_r is the literal absolute activity of all connected original blocks
of sizes 2 through r. The finite bound and exact difference are unconditional.
Under the existing ordinary explicit BCN premise, the already checked
fixed-order half-power estimates at the finitely many orders up to r give

    0 <= A_r - A_r_connected <= N^(-1+epsilon)

eventually uniformly over critical lengths and all dyadic subgrounds.
The threshold depends on r before N; no growing-order conclusion is made.
This is a sharper remainder for nonconnected families. The source 4/5
connected bound and separate contact estimate of T14.1 remain open.
Main 4.4 stays proved and companion T14.1 stays in progress. Coverage stays
77/167 (main 28/73, companion 49/94), confirmed improvements stay 90.
No new external input, axiom, dependency download, source-byte change or
Palomar registration is introduced.

Ubuntu root free space: 15.28 GiB. Exact canonical original block images, connectedness, coefficient/absolute factorization, nonzero block size and the finite quadratic polymer tail are unconditional. Under existing explicit BCN, nonconnected activity and the absolute all/connected activity difference are at most N^(-1+epsilon) at every fixed positive order, uniformly over dyadic subgrounds. Growing orders and the source sharp connected/contact bounds are not claimed. Main 4.4 stays proved; companion T14.1 stays in progress. Coverage 77/167, improvements 90.


## The contact part of T14.1 is proved

The contact conclusion of companion T14.1 is now proved at its full
N^(-1+epsilon) scale, unconditionally, on every original dyadic subground
and at every fixed order r>=2. The actual population consists exactly of
r-site families containing distinct sites x<y<=x+L, with no connectedness
restriction. Irregular starts, incompatible families and zero marginals
are included. The separate source connected 4/5 conclusion remains open,
so T14.1 remains in progress and no numbered result is counted complete.

The proof gives a more general finite statement on an arbitrary finite
Boolean probability space. For actual heterogeneous marginals p_x, a
family containing one of the specified two-site seeds satisfies

    sum_I |c(I)| <= R^(r-2) * sum_e(q(e)+3*prod_(x in e)p_x)
                   + E[(Z+mu)^m]/R^(m-r),

for every R>0 and fixed integer m>=r. No independence, regularity, common
marginal or positive seed mass is assumed. Absolute centered products are
bounded by products of J_x+p_x. The finite seed-cover inequality bounds
the family sum by the positive seed sum times (Z+mu)^(r-2). Below R this
costs R^(r-2) times the seed sum; above R the full product is bounded by
the higher moment divided by R^(m-r). The seed expectation is exactly
q(e)+3*prod p, retaining all four Boolean expansion terms.

For the original arithmetic model, a positive joint close pair must have
y=x+L, by exact run separation. The actual endpoint seed count bounds its
total joint mass. An explicit forward-neighbor cover proves
sum_(close e)prod p <= L*p_max*mu, including all heterogeneous marginals.
The contact seed kernel is therefore at most N^(-1+delta) for every fixed
delta>0. Every fixed positive-envelope moment E[(Z+mu)^m] is also at most
N^delta, using the newly checked unconditional subpower count moments.
Choose delta=epsilon/(4(r+1)), then one fixed higher moment m before N,
and finally R=N^delta. Both truncation terms have the required exponent;
the last constant is absorbed only after these exact estimates.

This replaces the source contact proof's use of uniformly bounded fixed
moments by the weaker unconditional subpower estimates. It also removes
the regular-ground/common-marginal restriction from this contact conclusion.
The proof is recorded as improvement P1-MATH-0091 for a future manuscript
revision. It asserts no source error, connected 4/5 bound, growing-order
control or complete fixed-moment asymptotic. Main 6.4 and T14.1 remain in
progress; coverage 77/167 (main 28/73, companion 49/94), improvements 91.

## Finite good-channel activity at source scale

The actual unordered private source pairs in every fixed rational channel
are now constructed. Forward orientation is injective, so their joint mass
is exactly half the already checked ordered channel mass. This family keeps
all affine-incompatible pairs. An injection into a dyadic center and the
integer displacement bx-ay proves the source-scale O(N(L+1)) cardinality
bound, with explicit constant 2(a+b)+1; it improves the earlier auxiliary
quadratic logarithmic cover without changing any source conclusion.

Every such pair is regular and has exact relative nullity |units|-1>0.
Its nullity is at most (L+1)/b. Its actual joint probability and absolute
centered coefficient are each at most p_nominal^2*2^((L+1)/b). Uniformly
through the critical band, the latter is at most N^(-2+1/b+epsilon).
All these bounds retain the exact affine incompatibility convention.
Filtering to positive joint mass constructs the literal compatible dependent
edge population of one fixed private channel, with the same cardinality,
rank and probability bounds and unchanged total joint mass.

The signed activity of the unfiltered family is exactly half the channel
mass minus its independent-product mass. Its absolute activity differs
from half the channel mass by at most that independent mass. On the
compatible family the absolute activity equals the same subtraction with
the restricted product mass. The unfiltered product mass is at most
N^(-1+epsilon), uniformly in the prime cutoff. Each fixed interior channel
therefore has total absolute activity at most N^(-1+1/b+epsilon), when
2b(L+1)<=H<=D(L+1). Any fixed finite union of the source channels with
b>=3 has total activity at most N^(-2/3+epsilon). The finite channel set,
cutoff multiplier, epsilon and all thresholds are fixed before N. These
proofs are unconditional; no BCN premise or target activity estimate is used.

This completes the individual-weight and finite-good-channel contributions
needed by T7.1 and begins the actual edge population for main 3.4. The full
classification of the remaining regular macroscopic pairs, the sharp 4/5
residual, the complete two-channel beta comparison and the full A2 upper
bound remain open. T7.1 stays in progress; main 3.4 moves from not_started
to in_progress. Coverage remains 77/167 (main 28/73, companion 49/94),
confirmed improvements 91. No new mathematical correction, external input,
axiom, download, original-source change or Palomar registration is claimed.

## Exact-contact refinements and improvement P1-MATH-0094

The literal dyadic exact-contact edge family is now constructed as
{x,x+L} with both starts in I_N. If the full union window of length 2L
is regular, every prescribed pair atom is exactly 2^(-2L). This follows
from a general full-effective-rank tuple uniformity theorem; affine
compatibility is proved by full rank rather than assumed. Uniform
irregular-window counts apply at length 2L with the enlarged logarithmic
width, and at least N/2 admissible contact starts have regular unions.
Consequently there is a positive c_C with

    c_C*N^(-1) <= M_contact <= N^(-1+epsilon)

for all sufficiently large critical N,L. The lower bound retains the
actual moving length phase through 2^(-2L). The general positive-family
activation theorem then gives

    N^(-1-epsilon) <= P(an active exact-contact edge) <= N^(-1+epsilon).

A generic positive-mass cover theorem proves that deleting probability-zero
members preserves the actual activation probability. Every positive-mass
close pair has separation exactly L, so the same probability bounds hold
for the event that two original active starts have distance at most L.
All statements concern the original infinite prime-sign probability law,
with both dyadic endpoints enforced and no BCN premise.

For centered coefficients the regular unions contribute zero, since their
actual pair rank loss is zero. Only the irregular full unions remain.
Their subpower count, the actual N^(-2+epsilon) point mass cap and exact
heterogeneous marginal caps prove the stronger bound

    sum_(exact-contact e) |c(e)| <= N^(-2+epsilon).

This improvement is specific to exact separation L. Strictly closer,
incompatible pairs can have negative centered coefficients and are not
included in that stronger exponent. It does not improve the already proved
N^(-1+epsilon) bound for all close-pair centered activity at arbitrary
fixed order. These positive-probability and exact covariance refinements
are recorded as improvement P1-MATH-0094. Main 6.3 stays proved; T7.1 and
T14.1 stay in progress. Coverage stays 77/167 (main 28/73, companion 49/94),
confirmed improvements 94. No full pair profile, multiplicative contact
probability equivalent, growing-order result, external premise, axiom,
dependency download, original-source change or Palomar registration is
introduced.
