# Complete aligned principal profile and the dense nonaligned residual

The entire original enlarged aligned unordered pair family is now
constructed using CompressedTargetAlignment.Aligned 1, with logarithmic
height at most (L+1)^3. Uniform dyadic geometry orients every representing
reduced channel as a <= b <= 2a. Its positive activity is covered by the
height-one and height-two boundary classes, private good 2:3 and 3:4
pairs, their normalized defects, zero-unit alignments, and the full
height-at-least-five tail. No disjointness of that cover is presumed.
Private one-unit pairs have zero actual centered coefficient, including
their affine prescription. All original irregular sites and zero exact
marginals are included.

Let beta be the actual joint mass of the compatible private principal
2:3 and 3:4 edges. For every fixed C, epsilon>0 and natural D, eventually
uniformly in the critical window and 8(L+1) <= H <= D(L+1), both the
absolute activity and the signed centered sum of ALL aligned pairs
differ from beta by at most N^(-4/5+epsilon). This is unconditional: no
BCN assumption is used. Separately, every pair subfamily F of the dyadic
block satisfies 0 <= A_F - C_F <= N^(-1+epsilon), uniformly over F.

An exact original-model identity splits alpha-2 beta into twice the
signed nonaligned sum, twice the aligned error, and the negative
single-site square diagonal. Consequently

    |alpha - 2 beta| <= 2 A_dense + N^(-4/5+epsilon).

Here dense is a literal finite residual family, not a presumed bound:
it consists only of regular, compatible nonaligned unordered pairs with
actual relative nullity greater than L/10. The weak, incompatible,
irregular and zero-coefficient classes have been removed using checked
estimates and an exact finite cover. The nonaligned complement retains
the full dyadic population before those removals.

The same bound holds with 2 beta replaced by the explicit sum
ChannelMainTermBounds.mainTerm N L 2 3 + mainTerm N L 3 4, using both
checked fixed-channel mass errors. These main terms retain the exact
signed finite channel sums, their source translation coefficients and
the nominal single-site scale; no phase limit is assumed.

This completes the aligned part of the actual second-cumulant profile.
It DOES NOT bound A_dense, prove the hard dense nonaligned weighted
estimate T1.8, or complete the unweighted positive/signed profile,
main 3.3 or T7.1. Both numbered results stay in progress and T1.8 stays
not started. Coverage stays 77/167 (main 28/73, companion 49/94), with
94 confirmed improvements. No new correction, external premise, axiom,
dependency download, original manuscript edit or Palomar registration
is introduced.

## Retaining the strict nonaligned rank gap

The literal original nonaligned family now has a finite positive host
bound. Every nonzero covariance is represented by an ordered increasing
nonaligned full-loss host. A joint cap M gives

    A_nonaligned <= #hosts * M + independent_host_mass.

The representation includes locally irregular sites, zero marginals and
affine incompatibility. It does not assume pairwise independence or a
positive covariance sign. Zero-loss pairs are removed only after their
actual centered coefficient has been proved zero.

With exactly the existing explicit BCN premise
PlaneCurvePointCount.UniformBound c kappa, c>0, put
s=(2/3) log 2. The already checked nonaligned joint cap N^(-2+s+delta)
and unconditional host count N^(1+delta) give

    A_nonaligned <= N^(-1+s+epsilon).

Independently, the complete aligned family satisfies the unconditional
bound A_aligned <= N^(-2/3+epsilon). Its cutoff can be chosen internally
as H=8(L+1), so this statement has no free private-prime cutoff.

The exact aligned/nonaligned partition therefore gives, under the same
explicit BCN premise and uniformly over every deterministic subset G
of the original dyadic block,

    A_2(G) <= N^(-1+s+epsilon),
    |alpha(G)| <= N^(-1+s+epsilon),
    ||B_2(G)-Q(actual mean, actual alpha)||_1 <= N^(-2+s+epsilon).

The exact single-site square diagonal is retained in alpha. Since
1/3 <= s < 1/2, these improve the previous coarse -1/2 activity/cumulant
and -3/2 conversion exponents by the strict gap 1/2-s. The first two
exponents are approximately -0.5379, and the conversion exponent is
approximately -1.5379. This is the analytic conversion of the finite
second-order reference, not an error bound for the complete count law.

All parameters c, kappa, C and epsilon are fixed before the common
threshold; lengths and deterministic subsets vary afterwards. BCN is an
ordinary theorem argument, not a new kernel axiom or an internally proved
external result. No stronger unformalized input is introduced.

These are intermediate rates, weaker than the source's sharp -2/3 pair
rate and -5/3 conversion rate. They do not establish the weighted dense
nonaligned estimate or finish main 3.3, 3.4, 15.1 or T7.1. All four
remain in progress; T1.8 stays not started. Coverage stays 77/167
(main 28/73, companion 49/94), and confirmed improvements stay 94.
