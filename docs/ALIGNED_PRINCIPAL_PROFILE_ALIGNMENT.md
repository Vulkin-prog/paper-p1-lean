# Complete aligned principal profile and the dense nonaligned residual

The entire original enlarged aligned unordered pair family is now
constructed using CompressedTargetAlignment.Aligned 1, with logarithmic
height at most (L+1)^3. Uniform dyadic geometry orients every representing
reduced channel as a <= b <= 2a. Its positive activity is covered by the
height-one and height-two boundary classes, private good 2:3 and 3:4
pairs, their normalized defects, zero-unit alignments, and the full
height-at-least-five tail. No disjointness of that cover is presumed.
Private one-unit pairs have zero actual centered coefficient, including
their affine prescription. All original irregular sites and zero exact
marginals are included.

Let beta be the actual joint mass of the compatible private principal
2:3 and 3:4 edges. For every fixed C, epsilon>0 and natural D, eventually
uniformly in the critical window and 8(L+1) <= H <= D(L+1), both the
absolute activity and the signed centered sum of ALL aligned pairs
differ from beta by at most N^(-4/5+epsilon). This is unconditional: no
BCN assumption is used. Separately, every pair subfamily F of the dyadic
block satisfies 0 <= A_F - C_F <= N^(-1+epsilon), uniformly over F.

An exact original-model identity splits alpha-2 beta into twice the
signed nonaligned sum, twice the aligned error, and the negative
single-site square diagonal. Consequently

    |alpha - 2 beta| <= 2 A_dense + N^(-4/5+epsilon).

Here dense is a literal finite residual family, not a presumed bound:
it consists only of regular, compatible nonaligned unordered pairs with
actual relative nullity greater than L/10. The weak, incompatible,
irregular and zero-coefficient classes have been removed using checked
estimates and an exact finite cover. The nonaligned complement retains
the full dyadic population before those removals.

The same bound holds with 2 beta replaced by the explicit sum
ChannelMainTermBounds.mainTerm N L 2 3 + mainTerm N L 3 4, using both
checked fixed-channel mass errors. These main terms retain the exact
signed finite channel sums, their source translation coefficients and
the nominal single-site scale; no phase limit is assumed.

This completes the aligned part of the actual second-cumulant profile.
It DOES NOT bound A_dense, prove the hard dense nonaligned weighted
estimate T1.8, or complete the unweighted positive/signed profile,
main 3.3 or T7.1. Both numbered results stay in progress and T1.8 stays
not started. Coverage stays 77/167 (main 28/73, companion 49/94), with
94 confirmed improvements. No new correction, external premise, axiom,
dependency download, original manuscript edit or Palomar registration
is introduced.
